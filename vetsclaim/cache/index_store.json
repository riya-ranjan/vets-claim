Also, exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this determination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of more than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the mailpiece (see 601.3.3).|\n|2.5|Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces|\n| |Flat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are considered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable parcel prices.|\n\n## Physical Standards for Parcels\n\n|3.1|Processing Categories|\n|---|---|\n| |USPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories: machinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e83a8d47-6286-4de5-a794-73cc583ff866":{"id_":"e83a8d47-6286-4de5-a794-73cc583ff866","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/101.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"f928689b-ed41-4349-a53d-855edfcabd64","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/101.pdf"},"hash":"ISFH3F3lRpg3ycED99oxF2dS9Tp+mjYB7jeOq3o2zFA="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"40214db5-d0aa-4620-b0f4-ae8b7bb67e82","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/101.pdf"},"hash":"eI+OSy+0J6jYGQfgexlctdFxQAS4NvXF+NObxwMobPs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9ffeb96d-1c74-444f-84b8-90e3c1569b1b","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/101.pdf"},"hash":"SrEqtVR/VktcLkZXORyO09FmN9QXUeXX/E8mbwO/rtc="}},"hash":"5zOc2e7EG3YXWNB9OUi0fwxFLpWjKCYLF+uxg8DngwE=","text":"These categories are based on the physical dimensions of the piece, regardless of the placement (orientation) of the delivery address on the piece.

VA General Counsel precedential opinions are binding on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. § 14.507. ## January 2016 VA Examination\n\nIn January 2016, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in conjunction with his claim. The examiner reviewed the claims file and conducted an in-person examination of the Veteran. The examiner found that the Veteran was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer as of March 2013. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was the result of his service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II. In reaching his conclusion, although the examiner acknowledged \"reports of a 3 [times] increased risk for type II diabetics to develop pancreatic carcinoma,\" the examiner concluded that \"this is often attributed to the pancreatic cancer causing the diabetes. \" The examiner did not address whether the Veteran's service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II, aggravated his pancreatic cancer beyond its natural progression, nor did he opine as to whether the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was related to service, including to his conceded exposure to herbicide agents. ## June 2019 Remand\n\nIn a June 2019 Remand, the Board noted that the January 2016 examiner did not address the fact that the Veteran's diabetes predated his pancreatic cancer by 13 years, and that the examiner's opinion represented a generalized medical treatise rationale not tailored to the specific facts of the Veteran's case. The Board then concluded that the January 2016 medical opinion was inadequate, as it was supported by a conclusory, incomplete rationale, did not take the Veteran's specific circumstances into account, and did not address whether his diabetes aggravated his pancreatic cancer beyond its natural progression or whether his pancreatic cancer was directly related to service, including herbicide exposure. ## November 2019 VA Opinion\n\nDespite the positive VA opinion, the RO requested another VA medical opinion as to the probable etiology of the Veteran's pancreatic cancer in January 2020, finding that the November 2019 opinion lacked sufficient rationale. As such, an additional VA opinion was obtained in February 2020. The February 2020 examiner opined that it was less likely as not that the Veteran's pancreatic cancer began in, or was otherwise caused by or related to, his time in service, to include any known exposure to herbicide agents.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ff23c153-3e42-4a0f-b76a-654a4214acf3":{"id_":"ff23c153-3e42-4a0f-b76a-654a4214acf3","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bdcf13cf-09a3-4ad8-a8a4-46766c1eff9a","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"+WGXi9icQMs+HjTz5tMZT63knc9zUbL3r3Q0+3NoU8Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"24621d24-321e-42e4-86a9-6456b433618c","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"ydx6VPrKlsA5+7X8TsHHXFwOqG4IZRy7sNSuoq+X7zg="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"e4b09bfb-cf50-45a1-a542-5663f3518115","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"oSWRqof+NhSJ13NWZIZUzzQ7FWnw5qeNuiDewnD/YNY="}},"hash":"Qhe+266hI2JdRx189CyKWqxgMQ1agHiL/D5gB4ldV24=","text":"In support of this conclusion, the examiner explained that: There is no evidence of a diagnosis of, or other presentation of PC upon review of STR. Additionally, PC is almost always a devastating illness that causes death within relatively\n---\nshort periods of time, from the time of diagnosis, usually weeks, months, or relatively short period of years, depending on at what stage the condition is diagnosed at. Most often it is diagnosed at a later stage, resulting in the often short period of time until death. It would be unheard of for it to go for 40 to 50 years from onset to death. A large study, Institute of Medicine, Committee to Review the Health Effects in Vietnam Veterans of Exposure to Herbicides. Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2002. Washington: National Academy Press, 2003 [... ] concluded the following - \"Cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum have been extensively studied in Vietnam veterans, occupational groups with herbicide exposure, and people exposed to dioxins. These studies have yielded a fairly consistent pattern of no association between these exposures and any GI cancer. \"\n\nThe February 2020 examiner also opined that it was less likely as not that the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was caused by his service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II. In support of this conclusion, the examiner explained that:\n\nDiabetes has not been established as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Although epidemiologic studies describe an association between pancreatic cancer and diabetes mellitus there are competing theories to explain this association. One model suggests an etiologic relationship whereby diabetes mellitus causes pancreatic cancer. Other models suggest diabetes may be a consequence rather than a cause of pancreatic cancer. There is evidence supporting both of these models and there is no current consensus regarding which model best explains the observed association . . . Thus diabetes mellitus has not been established as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Again, in a July 2021 Remand, the Board found that the February 2020 VA opinion broadly discussed conflicting medical literature with respect to the relationship between diabetes and pancreatic cancer, and failed to discuss facts specific to the Veteran's case. As such, the matter was remanded again in order to obtain an adequate etiological opinion.

However, the examiner also opined that it was at least as likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) that the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was caused or aggravated by his service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II. In support of these opinions, the examiner explained that:\n\nThe medical literature documents that long-term Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is associated with a 1.5 to 2.0 fold increase in the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and after cigarette smoking and obesity, is the third modifiable risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer. It should be noted that cigarette smoking and obesity are also established risk factors for developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; therefore, it is not completely certain if Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, in and of itself, is an independent risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer. The medical literature also documents that insulin resistance with associated hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and inflammation are possibly the underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of diabetes-associated pancreatic cancer. It has been shown that various signaling pathways that regulate the metabolic process also play an important role in cell proliferation and tumor growth, which can result in the development of pancreatic cancer. The medical literature also documents that the antidiabetic medication, Metformin, has been associated with a reduced risk in the development of pancreatic cancer in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and has been recognized as an antitumor agent with the potential to prevent and / or treat pancreatic cancer. It is important to note that Veteran Behrendt had been on Metformin in the past for his treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). T2DM has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of developing liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and bladder cancer [1-4]. Pancreatic cancer is known to cause diabetes and the onset of the diabetes can develop a few years prior to the diagnosis of the pancreatic cancer. This has been shown in more than 20 case-control studies and in approximately 20 cohort and nested case-control studies [4].","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a9b4accc-988c-4889-9654-d67209981480":{"id_":"a9b4accc-988c-4889-9654-d67209981480","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bdcf13cf-09a3-4ad8-a8a4-46766c1eff9a","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"+WGXi9icQMs+HjTz5tMZT63knc9zUbL3r3Q0+3NoU8Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"e4b09bfb-cf50-45a1-a542-5663f3518115","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"oSWRqof+NhSJ13NWZIZUzzQ7FWnw5qeNuiDewnD/YNY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"08ed8b37-6b36-4c82-a1ed-3cf4fcbaa3f2","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"Dj7AjaEwroI07JJPfwxfyCdPS44TbsxN6lxMjFN8yew="}},"hash":"eVj1alxXecrepBICWnfuSFmZIqKW7+VCF22/Qd0fTkU=","text":"There is some limited evidence in the medical literature that supports an independent association between long-standing T2DM and pancreatic cancer regardless of smoking status or\n---\nBMI; however, these studies have been limited in their size and scope with numerous authors noting that larger studies need to be performed. Biomarker studies are supportive of a relationship between long-standing T2DM and the risk for developing pancreatic cancer. These studies have involved such biomarkers as serum insulin levels [5], circulating levels of C-peptide / insulin [6], and postload plasma glucose levels greater than 200 mg/dL [7-9]. The mechanism by which T2DM can cause pancreatic cancer is complex and not completely known. What is known is that the pathophysiology involves metabolic, hormonal, and immunological alterations that influence pancreatic cells to become neoplastic. The most well understood mechanism underlying the association between long-standing T2DM and pancreatic cancer involves insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia and elevated levels of circulating insulin-like growth factors. Various animal studies have shown that stimulation of islet cells to proliferate can enhance pancreatic ductal cell carcinogenesis [10], and destruction of islet cells by treatment with Streptozotocin (a naturally occurring alkylating antineoplastic agent that is particularly toxic to the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas in mammals) or Alloxan (a toxic glucose analogue that selectively destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas) can inhibit pancreatic cancer induction [11,12]. Additional animal studies have demonstrated that treatment with the biguanide, Metformin, combined with a high-fat diet can normalize the rate of islet cell turnover, thus preventing pancreatic tumors to develop [13,36-46]. The literature documents that insulin is a growth-promoting hormone with mitogenic effects, which promotes cell proliferation and increases glucose use, which are important for tumor development and progression [14]. Insulin also upregulates the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) by reducing hepatic production of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins [15,16]. IGFs have mitogenic (mitogens are a peptide or small protein that induce a cell to begin cell division) and anti-apoptotic (apoptosis = natural programmed cell death) properties making them potent at increasing islet cell proliferation.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"08ed8b37-6b36-4c82-a1ed-3cf4fcbaa3f2":{"id_":"08ed8b37-6b36-4c82-a1ed-3cf4fcbaa3f2","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bdcf13cf-09a3-4ad8-a8a4-46766c1eff9a","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"+WGXi9icQMs+HjTz5tMZT63knc9zUbL3r3Q0+3NoU8Y="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a9b4accc-988c-4889-9654-d67209981480","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22013015.pdf"},"hash":"eVj1alxXecrepBICWnfuSFmZIqKW7+VCF22/Qd0fTkU="}},"hash":"Dj7AjaEwroI07JJPfwxfyCdPS44TbsxN6lxMjFN8yew=","text":"In addition to the direct growth-promoting effects of insulin and IGFs, T2DM and / or related obesity can increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer by increasing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses [17-35]. The medical literature is silent on Agent Orange being a direct cause for developing pancreatic cancer, or in and of itself, causing an increased risk for developing pancreatic cancer. Therefore, based on the evidence provided in the veteran's medical records and a review of the medical literature, the veteran's pancreatic cancer was multifactoral in etiology. Therefore, it is at least as likely as not that the veteran's long-standing Type II Diabetes Mellitus was a contributing cause to the development of his pancreatic cancer. Along with the T2DM, other likely contributing causes were the veteran's age being greater than 50 years, being of male gender, having a history of cigarette smoking, and being obese. Based on the above evidence, the Board finds that entitlement service connection for pancreatic cancer is warranted. There is no dispute that the Veteran had pancreatic carcinoma, as noted in the VA treatment records generated prior to his death. Moreover, the November 2019 and August 2021 VA examiners opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was caused by his service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II, among other factors. In support of his positive nexus opinion, the August 2021 examiner gave a detailed rationale supported by medical treatise evidence as well as the Veteran's specific medical history. Further, the Board notes that the Veteran has been service connected for diabetes mellitus, type II, since July 2001; thus, the last element for secondary service-connection, a service-connected disability, has also been met. Considering the foregoing, the Board finds that all elements of service connection on a secondary basis for pancreatic cancer have been met and service connection is thus warranted.

Historically, with respect to the issues in this decision, the matter is originally on appeal from a March 2018 rating decision which granted service connection for hemorrhoids, tinnitus, and hearing loss and denied service connection for the issues on appeal in this decision as well as the issues of service connection for traumatic brain injury (TBI), vertigo, cysts on arms, a psychiatric disability, ocular migraine, and a right-hand finger disability. In June 2018, the Veteran submitted his Notice of Disagreement with respect to the issues denied in the March 2018 rating decision; in April 2020, a Statement of the Case was issued; and in May 2020, the Veteran perfected his appeal. In July 2020, the Board remanded the issues denied in the March 2018 rating decision for additional development to include providing VA examinations and obtaining etiology opinions to include whether hypertension, GERD, urinary disorder, OSA, prostate disorder, and erectile dysfunction were at least as likely as related to service including presumed exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune or caused or aggravated by TBI.

In addition, on VA examinations in February 2018, the Veteran reported onset of pain with urination and a weaker stream and being diagnosed as having BPH in 1980; onset of heartburn in 1978 and being diagnosed as having GERD in 1980; and onset of erectile dysfunction in 2005. As such, there is no evidence in the Veteran's service treatment records that shows that he suffered from a urinary disability, GERD, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, a prostate disability, or OSA during service.

Thus \"veteran\" status has been attained during the period of June 1963 to December 1963. Hypertension and prostate cancer, however, were not shown as chronic in service, did not\n---\nmanifest to a compensable degree within a presumptive period, and were not noted in service with attributable continuity of symptomatology. VA treatment records do not show that the Veteran was diagnosed with either hypertension or prostate cancer within a year of his discharge from his period of ACTDUTRA from June 1963 to December 1963. The Board notes that on VA examination in May 2021, the Veteran reported that his hypertension began in 1968 with elevated blood pressures while in service, more than a year after his discharge from his period of ACTDUTRA from June 1963 to December 1963. In addition, the record is devoid of objective evidence of hypertension until 2017, the first post-service treatment records in the claims file; and the Veteran was diagnosed as having prostate cancer in 2022. Also, with respect to statutory presumptions, the Veteran's service personnel records indicate that he was stationed at Camp Lejeune during service from September 9, 1963, to October 3, 1963, and from July 16, 1966, to July 30, 1966; and, therefore, exposure to contaminated water is conceded. The Veteran, however, is not claiming service connection for any of the presumptive disabilities; and prostate cancer is not one of the diseases for which service connection on a presumptive basis as due to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune is available. Nonetheless, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that a claimant is not precluded from establishing service connection with proof of actual direct causation. Combee v.

In this case, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that a medical nexus exists between a current urinary disability, GERD, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, a prostate disability, or OSA and an in-service injury, event or disease or a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.310. The Veteran has undergone many VA examinations, and many VA opinions have been rendered. In February 2018, a VA examiner noted that the Veteran's file was silent for any issues pertaining to any urinary tract conditions or treatments, any treatment for a prostate condition, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, a prostate disability, or OSA and that such opined that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction, prostate disorder, urinary tract disorder, and acid reflux were less likely than not incurred in or caused by an in-service injury, event, or illness. In September 2020, an independent medical opinion was rendered by an occupational medicine physician that the Veteran's hypertension, GERD, OSA, urinary condition, BPH, and erectile dysfunction were less likely incurred in service or caused by the Veteran's exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. The examiner stated,\n\nThe Veteran's hypertension was due to personal risk factors including poor diet including salt intake, lack of exercise, obesity, hyperlipidemia, gender, age, drinking, high cholesterol, pre-diabetes. Thus, the Veteran's personal risk factors significantly outweigh the small environmental exposure risk posed by low level solvent exposure in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune for less than 3 and 12 months duration. Workers who developed hypertension were exposed to solvents a[t] levels one thousand times higher than the levels found in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune and for periods of three to five years duration of exposure. The Camp Lejeune cohort was exposed to solvents for 18 months and the [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] ATSDR did not find any incidence of hypertension in the cohort of exposed service members.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"2a8782f0-cae7-4759-b21a-7fd645ed3a84":{"id_":"2a8782f0-cae7-4759-b21a-7fd645ed3a84","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"912c66e1-2634-4121-8290-15a728051122","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"FkDtBSEAu9FHjHEV4kDi4hBKdNPKX8A3EBeF0lyQhgY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"cd5f692a-64c2-4636-9ff6-e4ccc99f2565","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"Y9H5jR/oxmKeiEF1wx3qk+QUvEYd9CNGfl1QHMEwUeM="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"5a9d44cc-5ff1-4191-afec-c05965394bfe","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"JEi1M9RbqoV9Ge51QnOZViE/TqzgTFpOPd/lC5Dq0Oc="}},"hash":"TQx7tEHw8JORkuty/GWkZG5jTsbJvDVj3WzcXt98UXU=","text":"The Veteran was exposed for less than 3 and 12 months which was less than 20 percent of the average exposure of service members stationed at Camp Lejeune so his risk was exceedingly low and it makes it unlikely that his hypertension was due to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. The veteran's personal risk factors for Chronic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease outweighed the Veteran's exposure risk from solvent contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. The Veteran's personal risk factors included gender, NSAID use including Motrin, drinking alcohol, poor diet and obesity. The combination of the Veteran's drinking, obesity, poor diet and medication use acted together to increase the Veterans risk of developing GERD. The ATSDR\n---\nin their Assessment of the Evidence for the Drinking Water Contaminants at Camp Lejeune and Specific Cancers and Other Diseases, Jan 13, 2017 found no evidence of an increased incidence of Chronic Gastrointestinal conditions to include GERD in the Camp Lejeune cohort. The ATSDR Morbidity Study of Former Marines, Employees, and Dependents Potentially Exposed to Contaminated Drinking Water at U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune published in April, 2018 also noted no increase in GERD in service members exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. This makes it unlikely that these exposures contributed to the Veterans development of GERD. It is more likely that the Veteran's alcohol use, medication use, poor diet, (high in fat and caffeine), and obesity caused the development of the Veteran's GERD. The Veteran's service treatment records did not have a diagnosis of a sleep disorder. On the Veteran's separation exam, the Veteran denied any problems to include sleep conditions. There was no continuity of symptoms from service to the present. The Veteran was at Camp Lejeune from 9/7/1963 to 12/18/1963.

There have been studies in the medical literature that evaluated the effects of chlorinated solvents on development or worsening of sleep apnea and no effects were observed. A recent study conducted by Saygun et al. examined the effects of long-term low-level solvent exposure on cognitive function and found no significant difference in the exposed and control groups for cognitive function or behavioral effects. If the Veteran had a sleep condition, his personal risk factors for Sleep Apnea would outweigh any environmental risk the Veteran had due to contaminated water exposure at Camp Lejeune. The veteran has several risk factors for sleep apnea that include obesity, the Veteran's age, male sex, hypertension, and pre-diabetes. Sleep apnea is more common in middle and older age adults. OSA is two times more common in men, especially in middle age. People who are obese have four times the risk of sleep apnea. Fat deposits around the upper airway and may obstruct breathing. Thus, the Veteran's personal risk factors markedly increased the Veteran's risk of developing Obstructive Sleep Apnea and outweighed any environmental risk posed by exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. The Veteran has prostate problems that likely increased his personal risk of Incontinence. In addition, changes as we age reduce how much your bladder can hold and increase the chances of involuntary urine release. The Veteran is 76 years old so he is at increased risk of incontinence due to his age. In addition, the Veteran is obese which increases pressure on the bladder and surrounding muscles, which weakens them and allows urine to leak out when you cough or sneeze. Diabetes may increase the risk of incontinence and the Veteran has pre-diabetes so he is at some increased risk of incontinence. Further, the Veteran has an enlarged prostate which increases his risk of incontinence especially in older men due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"02f4756d-9bec-4ef6-a88d-896de8f492e2":{"id_":"02f4756d-9bec-4ef6-a88d-896de8f492e2","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"912c66e1-2634-4121-8290-15a728051122","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"FkDtBSEAu9FHjHEV4kDi4hBKdNPKX8A3EBeF0lyQhgY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5a9d44cc-5ff1-4191-afec-c05965394bfe","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"JEi1M9RbqoV9Ge51QnOZViE/TqzgTFpOPd/lC5Dq0Oc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ef162bd8-c193-486c-b1cd-46d71d60a167","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"N/I14T8ounnpKU+/yyt5DeD95Db5ZkRoUSxx6wtDVc0="}},"hash":"jHJC14amfpskZvTkcgQBjkm6FWlykZ9qUODsFmUxxa4=","text":"The Veteran's personal risk factors outweighed the Veteran's environmental risk due to chlorinated solvent exposure at Camp Lejeune for 102 days.

The Veteran's BPH risk due to his personal risk factors that include obesity, age, gender, pre-diabetes, and family history outweighed his environmental exposure risk due to 102 days exposures at Camp Lejeune. It is less likely than not that the Veteran's ED was caused by or was related to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. The Veteran was exposed to environmental chemicals in the water at Camp Lejeune for less than 3 and 12 months.

It is more likely than not that the Veteran's BPH, Hypertension and treatment for hypertension with blood pressure medications and antidepressant medications caused the Veteran's Erectile Dysfunction. Hypertension and medications to treat hypertension both play a role in causing ED. High blood pressure keeps the arteries that carry blood into the penis from dilating the way they're supposed to because there is a disturbance of endothelium-derived factors that can lead to an increase in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction. It also makes the smooth muscle in the penis lose its ability to relax. As a result, not enough blood flows into the penis to make it erect. Blood pressure can also damage your arteries by causing them to become thicker. This can restrict blood flow to your penis, which may then cause erectile dysfunction. Hypertension can lead to erectile dysfunction as a consequence of anti-hypertensive treatment as well. Beta-blockers dampen the response to nerve impulses that lead to an erection. They also make it more difficult for the arteries in the penis to widen and let in blood. What's more, they can make you feel sedated and depressed which may play a part in limiting sexual arousal.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c9719668-4be4-4dc2-aa08-93f1046a1a27":{"id_":"c9719668-4be4-4dc2-aa08-93f1046a1a27","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"912c66e1-2634-4121-8290-15a728051122","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"FkDtBSEAu9FHjHEV4kDi4hBKdNPKX8A3EBeF0lyQhgY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ef162bd8-c193-486c-b1cd-46d71d60a167","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"N/I14T8ounnpKU+/yyt5DeD95Db5ZkRoUSxx6wtDVc0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"68056f37-cf2b-48f7-92b7-453f32b18f69","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"3DpJTUjiEHJxXrkg6tnCXrAeq0mKVRJyVuSg4LqWW0M="}},"hash":"MX9J3zyu2HiVTK2Uyzy/I5SZYIICyHAKAC7m+pUd7/E=","text":"Further, the Veteran's Obstructive Sleep Apnea may have aggravated the Veteran's hypertension which further contributed to the Veterans Erectile Dysfunction.

Thus, the February 2018 VA examiner opined that a urinary disability, GERD, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, a prostate disability, and OSA were not incurred or aggravated by a period of ACDUTRA.

In a February 2022 letter, the Veteran's attorney raised a theory of entitlement for service connection for a urinary condition, GERD, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, a prostate condition, and OSA, as due to TBI with obesity being an intermediate step. VA's Office of General Counsel issued a precedential opinion in January 2017 that concluded that obesity per se is not a disease or injury for purposes of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131; and, therefore, may not be service connected on a direct basis. Similarly, obesity is not a \"disability\" for the purposes of secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. However, VA's Office of General Counsel recognized that obesity may act as an \"intermediate step\" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service-connected on a secondary basis. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (January 6, 2017) (noting that this \"intermediate step\" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a) equates to an inquiry into proximate cause requiring a 3-step analysis, namely of (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the Veteran to become obese; (2) if so, whether the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the current disability; and (3) whether the current disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability. )\n\nIn August 2022, VA obtained a medical opinion that the Veteran's TBI was so mild that it was not at least as likely as not the cause of the Veteran's obesity, hypertension, GERD, urinary disorder, OSA, prostate disorders, and erectile dysfunction.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"6d1bd6e3-cbb4-48c4-a92d-5b943acec9d5":{"id_":"6d1bd6e3-cbb4-48c4-a92d-5b943acec9d5","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"912c66e1-2634-4121-8290-15a728051122","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"FkDtBSEAu9FHjHEV4kDi4hBKdNPKX8A3EBeF0lyQhgY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"84f29baf-7d4c-4ec7-95ea-4b29bd1d1b16","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"jtpX7buD19otyy1xogkuNHhaUucyn47yfCj1CKV9wpc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"28ef38d6-207b-47b2-bdcf-cb55b7a3712a","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"u6ZO7b4tZsN3WlMUvOFva/xgXTbdgO2tLAlRVya5dIc="}},"hash":"/sXTOv5Edl5UtrZpAMeKWz2HeDHwSIoKmoldQTWrBFw=","text":"Specifically, the examiner stated, Based on cumulative evidence, there is clear and unmistakable evidence that given the nature, extent, imaging, timing & onset of symptoms, and clinical findings, the Veteran's (now service connected) TBI was mild.

The Board understands that the August 2020 VA examiner was assessing the Veteran's TBI during service in 1963 and not the current residuals of TBI. The examiner specifically noted, \"Mild traumatic brain injury is defined as a traumatically-induced physiological disruption of brain function...\". At the VA TBI examination in February 2018, the Veteran described the following history, Veteran reported two concussive events during his service time. The first occurred in June 1963 while in training at P[a]rris [I]sland. He stated that was going through an obstacle course that included live fire which he got too close too. He was exposed to a nearby blast that lifted him off his feet and landed on his stomach striking his head and face on the ground. He stated he did not recall any residual symptoms as he was more concerned about getting out quickly. When he completed the course, he was amped up on adrenalin however, the drill sergeant noticed that he was bleeding from his nose and ear and was immediately sent to sick call. He does not recall any head pain following that evening or following days. The second event occurred in October 1963 while still at P[a]rris Island, he was going into the headquarters building which had designated \"In\" and \"Out\" doors that were large and heavy. He reported that as he approached the \"In\" door, an officer pushed the door open very quickly and with good force from inside the building, which struck the veteran in the head. He does not recall any details of the event until he came to in sick call. He had a laceration above his right eyebrow which he was given stitches for. The examiner, a neurologist, stated, Blows to the head and/or face such as those described by the veteran, are a common cause or trigger for patients to experience reoccurring chronic headaches and cognitive difficulty, as well as occasionally trigger neurobehavioral effects.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"440b0ad1-d1f4-4559-8f93-8583b5785cf8":{"id_":"440b0ad1-d1f4-4559-8f93-8583b5785cf8","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"912c66e1-2634-4121-8290-15a728051122","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"FkDtBSEAu9FHjHEV4kDi4hBKdNPKX8A3EBeF0lyQhgY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"28ef38d6-207b-47b2-bdcf-cb55b7a3712a","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"u6ZO7b4tZsN3WlMUvOFva/xgXTbdgO2tLAlRVya5dIc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"8de0659f-e3bb-44b7-b4a5-4b3a6fab0447","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"5BU7jkrgHG7DBC96I3hy/zBeH2QEddsJeYkrXDuXB2Y="}},"hash":"WtmFM9A2iwFrULTyhpqO3iNcLC5SZP/5PFzArznxsik=","text":"However, veteran's description of symptoms including timing of when symptoms occurred, are not consistent with post-traumatic diagnosis. Memory and neurobehavioral symptoms may be more closely related to age. It is unknown if veteran suffers from a mental health condition, however he did notate that he has occasional depression and anxiety. Therefore, it is impossible to determine which if any neurobehavioral symptoms are related to TBI vs. those caused by a possible mental health disorder without speculation. At the VA TBI examination in November 2020, the Veteran described the following history, On Oct 31, 1963 while stationed at Camp Lejeune, claimant was hit by a large heavy door. He lost consciousness for unknown period of time. The next thing he remembers is being in sick bay with his ear being sewn up. He experienced confusion upon awakening with trouble focusing. Claimant also recalls having a headache. His ear wound got infected. Claimant was climbing through a live fire training course at Camp Geiger around Sept 1963. He got close to a bomb pit when an explosion went off. Claimant denies frank LOC [loss of consciousness]. He was bleeding from his nose. This training exercise blast injury was associated with confusion and he felt pain in his face. These accounts are internally inconsistent; they are also inconsistent with the\n---\ncontemporaneous medical evidence. Although there is evidence of a right eyebrow wound with three visits to the dispensary on October 31, November 1, and November 4, 1963, for sutures, treatment for a superficial infection, and suture removal, respectively, there is no evidence of any loss of consciousness. On Report of Medical Examination on December 10, 1963, just over one month from the Veteran's right eyebrow wound, the Veteran's head, face, and neurologic health were evaluated as normal. On the Reports of Medical History completed by the Veteran in conjunction with his physicals in January 1965, June 1966, and June 1967, he denied ever having frequent or severe headache and dizziness or fainting spells. He also denied being treated by clinics, physicians, healers, or other practitioners within the prior five years except for nervous stomach in October 1964.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"8de0659f-e3bb-44b7-b4a5-4b3a6fab0447":{"id_":"8de0659f-e3bb-44b7-b4a5-4b3a6fab0447","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"912c66e1-2634-4121-8290-15a728051122","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"FkDtBSEAu9FHjHEV4kDi4hBKdNPKX8A3EBeF0lyQhgY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"440b0ad1-d1f4-4559-8f93-8583b5785cf8","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"WtmFM9A2iwFrULTyhpqO3iNcLC5SZP/5PFzArznxsik="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"2fc33abe-2545-49b0-b457-a066d6d6c42e","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/22067785.pdf"},"hash":"hPqOd4lLeXxym16cAGXsMbQT8ljt2KLtBQbiEq/r/Ho="}},"hash":"5BU7jkrgHG7DBC96I3hy/zBeH2QEddsJeYkrXDuXB2Y=","text":"As such, the Board finds that the August 2022 VA examiner's determination that the Veteran's TBI was mild is not contrary to the evidence of record. The Board, therefore, concludes that, although the Veteran has current diagnoses of a current urinary disability, GERD, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, prostate cancer and BPH, and OSA, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's disorders began during service, are otherwise related to his active duty service including exposure to contaminated water while stationed at Camp Lejeune, or are proximately due to or the result of, or aggravated beyond its natural progression by service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Allen v.

Although the Veteran believes that his urinary disability, GERD, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, prostate disability including cancer, BPH, and OSA are related to his period of ACTDUTRA or service-connected disability, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue. The issue is medically complex, requires specialized medical knowledge, and is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that he has the skills or medical training to make such a determination.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection is warranted for a urinary disability, GERD, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, prostate disability, BPH, and OSA.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from October 2016 and May 2017 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency\n---\nof Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran testified at a Board hearing in February 2022 and a transcript of the proceeding is of record. The Veteran's attorney submitted a Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act Request (FOIA)/(PA) for the Veteran's claims file in October 2022. The Board considers this request duplicative, as the Veteran's attorney already has access to the Veteran's entire electronic claims file, including the requested records, via the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS). VA is responding to the attorney's request, but the Board may proceed with adjudication of the claim as the Veteran's attorney has access to all evidence in the claims file.

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases, including degenerative arthritis, may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v.

For veterans presumed to have been exposed to herbicides, certain enumerated diseases shall be service connected even though there is no record of such disease during service, so long as the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii) are met, and the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1113 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

The Veteran alleges that a back disorder began during service and has existed since that time and is related to service. The evidence shows a current disability during the appeal period. See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). The Veteran is currently diagnosed with multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine, including lumbar spine degenerative joint and disc disease. See March 2014 and September 2016 VA imaging studies; see August 2022 VA examination report. For the purposes of this decision those diagnoses will collectively be referred to as the thoracolumbar spine disability. Second, resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, there was an in-service back injury. See Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). In September 2005, the Veteran wrote that he had muscle spasms and cramps of the back due to Agent Orange. At a September 2016 VA appointment, the Veteran reported a history of low back pain since 1969 that became worse after a 2013 motor vehicle accident. He related his initial low back pain to carrying crates in service, but he also reported injuring his low back several times but never receiving treatment. At the Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he fell approximately 10 feet off a pole and laid on the ground for about 10 minutes. After, he was able to get up and finish his job. He reported he did not seek treatment at the time because there was an incoming airstrike and he had to run to the bunker. Afterwards, he described continuous complaints regarding his back, and that he saw a chiropractor for 3 months after service. The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any back diagnoses or complaints. On the February 1968 report of medical history at separation, the Veteran specifically denied back trouble of any kind. The Veteran's STRs for his entire period of service were provided to VA, but those records do not include a separation examination.

The Veteran's military personal records show he worked as a field wireman during his period of deployment, and a fall from a telephone pole would be consistent with that type of work. It is also likely the Veteran carried heavy crates as he described. Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran had a fall from a pole and carried heavy crates. To the extent the Veteran reports constant or chronic back pain in service, his later testimony is inconsistent with his denial of any back trouble on the report of medical history at separation. The evidence of record does not support a finding that the current back disorder is related to active service, to include the reported fall and carrying heavy crates. The earliest available treatment records show that in February 2001, the Veteran reported a 1-year history of back pain with activity, and that he worked in construction. The Veteran continued to report back pain in October 2001, and the assessment was degenerative joint disease and sciatica. At an April 2002 appointment, the Veteran reported that he had intermittent back pain for the past 30 years, which would be around 1972. Another April 2002 record also reports the Veteran's post-service career was entirely in carpentry and construction. A January 2007 VA treatment note reports the Veteran had left-sided back pain, and that he was doing heavy lifting as a remodeler. August 2011 VA treatment notes report back pain after an injury at work and December 2015 treatment notes report back pain for a week after a heavy lift. The Veteran underwent a VA examination in August 2022. That examiner documented that degenerative joint and disc disease of the lumbar spine had been present since 2001, as well as the lay testimony of the in-service injury and symptoms since separation. At the examination, the Veteran again reported that his back problems began in service after he fell from a telephone pole. He denied treatment for back problems in service, but reported he began to see a chiropractor after separation. The examiner opined that the diagnosed conditions were not etiologically related to service. In support of that opinion, the examiner noted the Veteran's history of degenerative joint and disc disease dated from 2001, when he was over 50 years of age. The examiner explained that those were degenerative processes due to aging.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"7aae1585-f04d-4999-be1f-7f6231f4bf23":{"id_":"7aae1585-f04d-4999-be1f-7f6231f4bf23","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"be0e8ebb-5c52-4a0f-8c29-e9511ba262c6","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"1ju5jlEeE0AERSVgIlTvwnbV4KM93OOXq/89ZS2DwjM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f08bf449-b577-4421-a72c-eb578981986f","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"FFKZFfjlF3Oozolu6c47n6T2sMKJxgh6valffzQGWy8="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"a3e309ae-8deb-4119-bca1-f7f0aaae9895","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"M6YcOqUNyrggMuF4gASMKhg36L4UfXW8TPtJRCnP9Ek="}},"hash":"/jfghZ6V+EEVVvoXXuSpWVTjC+9DKTFcOZOxxj/EAYU=","text":"The examiner explained that those were degenerative processes due to aging.

Thus, the examiner\n---\nreasoned that the reported injury did not account for the current findings. The examiner further noted that the STRs were silent for any complaints of back pain during active duty service. The examiner also opined that symptoms of arthritis did not first manifest in service, or within a year of separation. In support of that opinion the examiner stated that the symptoms of back pain could overlap with other conditions of both spinal and non-spinal origin, such as strain, kidney conditions, or vascular disease. The examiner again noted the STRs showed no evidence of back pain in service, nor was there medical evidence of back pain in the year after separation from service. Even so, given the Veteran's age at the time of separation, any symptoms of back pain would be less likely due to arthritic disease than other potential etiologies. The examiner specifically stated they considered the lay testimony of an in-service fall, chronic intermittent back pain, and the reports of chiropractic care in 1969. The 2022 VA examiner's opinion is adequate because the examiner addressed the relevant medical evidence and the lay testimony. The examiner also provided clear rationales to support their conclusions. The 2022 opinion weighs heavily against the claim. At the August 2020 hearing, the Veteran's representative proffered that the low back pain and diagnoses could also be related to strenuous activity and heavy lifting common to military personnel, and mentioned they would provide medical articles supporting that proposition at a later time. Those articles have not been received by VA. The Veteran and his representative are lay persons and have not demonstrated the requisite medical training or expertise required to opine on the etiology of the Veteran's current back pain. Although the representative is competent to report what another medical professional has said, those articles are not of record. Further, the VA treatment records show the Veteran had a long, post-service career in various roles in the construction field that involved heavy lifting. See e.g. December 2015 VA treatment note.

Additionally, the weight of the evidence is against a finding that degenerative arthritis of the thoracolumbar spine manifested in service or within a year of separation. The 2022 examiner adequately explained why degenerative arthritis did not manifest in service or within a year of separation. There are no objective medical records showing treatment for or a diagnosis of arthritis in the year following separation. The Veteran's reports regarding chronic back pain since the in-service onset have been inconsistent. He denied back trouble at separation, he reported a 1-year history of back pain in February 2001, and a 30-year history of intermittent low back pain in April 2002. There are also no medical records prior to 2001 to support a finding of a chronic back condition. Overall, the lay testimony of chronic back pain since service is not consistent or supported by the objective evidence. As a result, the lay testimony is not deemed credible in this regard. Accordingly, service connection for the thoracolumbar spine disability is denied on a direct and presumptive basis. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to military environmental exposure or secondary to service-connected coronary artery disease, is granted pursuant to the PACT Act. Here, exposure to herbicide agents has already been conceded. See November 2021 VA Memo. The Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension, as documented by September 2019 VA treatment records. In accordance with the PACT Act, hypertension is now a disease presumptively associated with herbicide agents. Thus, service connection for hypertension is warranted under the PACT Act. The Board has considered whether service connection for hypertension is warranted under any theory of entitlement other than the PACT Act. However, in this case the record does not indicate, and the Veteran has not argued that hypertension had its onset during service.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"cea624ef-40f1-4604-8bbb-b166a53d0c02":{"id_":"cea624ef-40f1-4604-8bbb-b166a53d0c02","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"be0e8ebb-5c52-4a0f-8c29-e9511ba262c6","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"1ju5jlEeE0AERSVgIlTvwnbV4KM93OOXq/89ZS2DwjM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"a3e309ae-8deb-4119-bca1-f7f0aaae9895","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"M6YcOqUNyrggMuF4gASMKhg36L4UfXW8TPtJRCnP9Ek="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"b7bbf150-c0f4-4165-ad4b-17a1efdb116f","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"uP3vIKw/YH1f1Al4zWwR6J0wys8lgN6hbwcHIivBxPg="}},"hash":"FQb+NU+ksOhoK14z9a+TaVIoMpRuHxv+K4U2/HHR1MA=","text":"---\nThere is no competent medical evidence of record indicating that the Veteran's hypertension is directly related to any in-service illness or injury, to include in-service herbicide exposure. VA obtained a medical examination and opinion in August 2022. That examiner opined that hypertension was not directly related to service, to include any herbicide exposure. In support of that opinion, the examiner explained that the STRs did not show hypertension in service, and that the first post-service evidence of hypertension was 30 years after separation from service. The examiner noted that when hypertension was diagnosed, the Veteran was over 50, had a body mass index of 31.6, and had a positive family history of hypertension which were all established risk factors for the development of hypertension and the most likely cause of this Veteran's hypertension. The examiner further stated that there was no established causal relationship between hypertension and Agent Orange, and in the Veteran's case his age, obesity, and family history were the most likely cause and far outweighed any potential effect from his exposure to Agent Orange. Specifically regarding the most recent National Academy Of Sciences (NAS) report from 2018 regarding hypertension and herbicide exposure, the examiner explained that while there was sufficient evidence of an association, the data was still inconclusive when it came to establishing causality. The examiner went on to discuss that the study's findings were based on veterans of the Army Chemical Corps specifically. The examiner went on to state that review of other, current medical literature did not show an association between herbicide exposure and the development of hypertension. While the Veteran believes his hypertension is related to in-service herbicide exposure, as a layperson, the Veteran is not shown to have the relevant training or education to offer a medical opinion relating his hypertension to herbicide exposure, or to service generally.

The examiner explained that the radiographic evidence of coronary artery disease from 2017 and 2018 did not affirm a clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease. Rather, the gold standard for diagnosis of that condition was coronary catheterization/angiography or a diagnostic stress test. In the absence of those studies, the Veteran's noted coronary calcifications did not support the presence of associated inadequate blood supply that defines ischemic heart disorder. Further, the examiner explained that the Veteran's hypertension preceded the findings of coronary calcifications by 15 years, so there could be no causal relationship. The August 2022 VA examiner fully reviewed the medical evidence, lay testimony, and the NAS report identified in the prior Remand directives. The opinions are adequate, comply with the prior Remand directives, and weigh heavily against the claim. There is thus no competent evidence linking hypertension to in-service herbicide exposure, or to the service-connected coronary artery disease. Accordingly, at this time, no theory of entitlement allows for a grant of service connection for hypertension other than the PACT Act. Entitlement to service connection for cancer of the left tonsil, to include as due to military environmental exposure is denied. The Veteran seeks service connection for left tonsil cancer. The Veteran has been diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil and he was exposed to Agent Orange in service. See April 2017 VA treatment record. The remaining question before the Board is whether there is a nexus between the diagnosed condition and the in-service exposure.

In support of that opinion, the examiner explained that use of tobacco and alcohol were historically the principal risk factors for the development of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas such as the Veteran's left tonsil cancer. Another growing risk factor was human papillomavirus. Further, there was a 5- to 25-fold increased risk of head and neck cancer in heavy cigarette smokers compared with nonsmokers, and alcohol consumption further significantly increased the risk of cancer in the upper aerodigestive tract. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's documented history of alcohol use and longstanding/ongoing tobacco use were the known risk factors for the development his left tonsil cancer. In contrast, the examiner explained that in 2018 the NAS Institute of Medicine found there was inadequate or insufficient evidence of an association between Agent Orange exposure and the development of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas such as the Veteran's left tonsil cancer. The examiner's findings are consistent with other medical evidence. September 2016 VA treatment notes document the Veteran had a smoking history since 1967. November 2016 VA treatment notes state the Veteran was smoking 1 pack per day, down from 3 packs per day. February 2022 VA treatment notes report the Veteran was still smoking.

The Veteran asserts that COPD is etiologically related to service, to include in-service smoking and exposure to Agent Orange. COPD has been diagnosed during the appeal period and the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange in service. See e.g. August 2022 VA examination report. The remaining question is whether COPD is etiologically related to the Veteran's period of service, to include any military environmental exposure. At the outset, the claim for service connection for COPD due to tobacco use is prohibited by law. For claims received by VA after June 9, 1998, as is the case here, a disability that results from injury or disease attributable to a veteran's use of tobacco products during service will not be considered service-connected. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.300(a). Thus, COPD cannot be granted as directly related to the in-service tobacco use. Alternatively, the Veteran asserts that COPD is due to tobacco abuse, and that tobacco abuse is secondary to his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He explains that he began smoking during his deployment to Vietnam to cope with the stress, and that he continued to smoke/use tobacco to cope with chronic stress related to PTSD. Essentially, his contention is that tobacco abuse is an intermediate step between PTSD and the development of COPD. Precedent has established that obesity may serve as an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a current disability for purposes of secondary service connection. Walsh v.

Because there is no precedent or law creating an exception to the prohibition on service connection for a disability related to use of tobacco products, the claim must be denied under that theory of entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 3.300 (a). VA obtained a medical examination and opinion in August 2022. That examiner opined that the diagnosed COPD was not related to the Veteran's period of service, to include Agent Orange. In support of that opinion, the examiner reported the STRs were silent for a chronic or recurrent lung or respiratory condition during active duty. The examiner went on to explain there was no direct or causal association between herbicides or Agent Orange and the development of COPD based on review of medical literature. Also, the most predominant risk factor for the development of COPD was tobacco use. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's prolonged tobacco use was the likely etiology of his COPD. The examiner provided the opinions requested by the prior Remand and provided a well-reasoned rationale based on an accurate reporting of the evidence. The examiner's conclusion considered the relevant evidence and lay testimony. That opinion is adequate and weighs heavily against the claim. There is no other medical opinion to the contrary. VA treatment records dated November 2015 show a clinical impression of reactive airway disease due to cigarette smoking. November 2016 VA treatment notes report that 80 to 90 percent of COPD was caused by cigarette smoking. Other causes included occupational exposure, which accounted for 10 to 20 percent of COPD, passive exposure to tobacco smoke or environmental smoke, indoor air pollution such as heating due to wood or coal, occupational dusts and chemicals (fumes, vapors, and irritants), or a genetic disorder. The VA treatment records are consistent with the VA examiner's conclusion that COPD was likely due to the Veteran's long-term tobacco use. Although the Veteran has expressed a belief that COPD may be due to Agent Orange, he lacks the medical expertise necessary to competently opine on a complex etiology opinion.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"41ab248e-ba61-43f6-988b-f079682a7731":{"id_":"41ab248e-ba61-43f6-988b-f079682a7731","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"be0e8ebb-5c52-4a0f-8c29-e9511ba262c6","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"1ju5jlEeE0AERSVgIlTvwnbV4KM93OOXq/89ZS2DwjM="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"1abfb1a3-05f1-4183-b9e2-117348d1f4b1","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"d8acqjrf7j+6EW+bwk9LiwYrEc1FiDTSZwCqHG926Gw="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"82cb94eb-038d-4fc5-82d9-06c9a20d3df7","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23002686.pdf"},"hash":"4HfQ6451bho7dTTbOwTVpy0XNkPjsjPbj0SzUYRLK64="}},"hash":"mlQUoOZOpnqZC+s36N7ff2XUUE+KQsQHTkmY/H0L75c=","text":"In sum, the competent evidence weighs heavily against a finding that COPD is etiologically related to service, to include military environmental exposure and service connection is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). ## REASONS FOR REMAND\n\nEntitlement to service-connection for a lung disorder other than COPD, to include benign lung nodules is remanded. This issue is remanded to secure an adequate opinion regarding whether lung nodules are etiologically related to military environmental exposure, specifically Agent Orange. VA obtained a medical examination and opinion in August 2022. That examiner opined that the diagnosed nonspecific lung nodules, first noted in 2017, were not due to military service or environmental exposure. In support of that opinion, the examiner stated that the Veteran did not have a lung disorder documented during service that would or could have contributed to the nonspecific lung nodules. The examiner also stated the Veteran's lung nodules were not lung cancer, so they were not presumptively related to Agent Orange. The examiner failed to address whether lung nodules could otherwise be directly related to Agent Orange. Thus, remand for an addendum opinion is required. February 2021 VA treatment records do show that there is concern the lung nodule could be a slow-growing malignancy, but a July 2022 VA CT scan showed no current evidence of pulmonary malignancy. November 2020 VA treatment notes document that a biopsy of the nodule did not show malignancy, but rather necroinflammatory debris. Because lung cancer has not yet been diagnosed, presumptive service connection for lung cancer due to Agent Orange exposure is not warranted at this time. The matters are REMANDED for the following action:\n\n1. Obtain an addendum opinion regarding the etiology of the nonspecific lung nodules from a\n---\nVA examiner. The entire claims file must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. If an examination is deemed necessary, it shall be provided.

In November 2019, the Veteran testified at a video conference hearing before the undersigned acting Veterans Law Judge. A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file and has been reviewed. In July 2020 the Board, among other things, remanded the above claim for further development. It has now returned to the Board for further appellate review. The Board notes that additional evidence was associated with the claims file since the RO issued the January 2021 supplemental statement of the case. See April 2021 VA Hypertension Examination. The Veteran did not waive agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of this evidence. Similarly, the record shows that the Veteran has not been provided notice of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022. See H.R. 3967. However, the Board first finds that the Veteran will not be prejudiced by adjudicating his claims without the AOJ first reviewing the evidence and without receiving notice of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022. The Board has reached this conclusion because the below decision is granting him service connection for hypertension, OSA, and respiratory disabilities diagnosed as\n---\nVasomotor rhinitis, pansinusitis, and bronchitis as well as because the additional evidence is not pertinent as to his claim of service connection for heart arrythmia. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran are to be avoided). Next, the Board notes that the Veteran has an appeal pending for entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). As such, this claim will be addressed in a separate decision. THE SERVICE CONNECTION CLAIMS\n\nThe Veteran contends that his hypertension, OSA, respiratory disabilities including vasomotor rhinitis, pansinusitis, and bronchitis, as well as heart arrythmia are related to service.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"674efaa0-87dd-48d8-9800-b97ac4c3d205":{"id_":"674efaa0-87dd-48d8-9800-b97ac4c3d205","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23011129.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"2b96a9c5-6821-4b95-b493-ddc1f85d6e16","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23011129.pdf"},"hash":"u17Xv0x+xQYxMMOB10KxQg6YceYh2zitf74D99wPPds="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fa759b0d-c609-43f4-9c51-de5a737aee29","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23011129.pdf"},"hash":"berYgJRnwKfWaecHSSjN2EIQdUwJD7g5YlMUOcK7WZo="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"c37630ca-adbe-44c4-8c59-050c5abb7fbd","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23011129.pdf"},"hash":"8IwHfjprM9xA46rGxZrC71n83L8qPBwiPyIMFbrV370="}},"hash":"hjPhIBQD9Fr1b0OysVWAj8sngESM+H7SNdhTLA18f7I=","text":"Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. งง 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. ง 3.303.

See, e.g., VA examination dated in April 2021. Next, as to the in-service disease or injury, service treatment records include numerous blood pressure readings that show his systolic blood pressure was 130 mm or higher. See 38 C.F.R. . ง 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101 (hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure\n---\nis \"predominantly\" 90 mm or greater and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm). Given this record, and granting the Veteran the benefit of any doubt in this matter, the Board concludes that he had a disease while on active duty.

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran is a Persian Gulf War Veteran and is entitled to the presumptions found at 38 U.S.C. ง 1117; 38 C.F.R. ง 3.317 to include it being presumed that he had toxin exposure during his time in the Persian Gulf War. See Joyner, supra; 38 U.S.C. ง 1117; 38 C.F.R. ง 3.317. In this regard, the Board also finds it significant that VA officially found this Veteran was exposed to Burn Pit Toxins, High Levels of Particulate Matter, Sulfur Dioxide, Hydrogen Sulfide, and Hexavalent Chromium. See VA Fact Sheet (Memorandum), Notice to VA Examiners, June 2016. Next, the Board finds it significant that because the Veteran's service personnel records\n---\nshow his being awarded of the Combat Action Ribbon, he meets the criteria to be characterized as a \"Combat Veteran. \" Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran is afforded the presumptions found at 38 U.S.C. ง 1154(b).

See 38 U.S.C. ง 1154(b); Reeves, supra. The Board also finds it significant that active duty treatment records document the Veteran's complaints and treatment or shortness of breath and shallow breathing as well as having a two year medical history of productive cough with wheezing. See, e.g., March 1999 Chest X-ray; May 2000 Report of Medical History. Further, and as noted above, due to his service in the Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War it is presumed he had exposure to toxins and VA has conceded that the Veteran had exposure to high levels of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hexavalent chromium from burn pits. Lastly, the Board finds that the Veteran provided competent and credible personal hearing testimony of having observable problems with adverse symptomatology normally attributable to OSA and chronic respiratory disorders (e.g., cessation of breathing during sleep, chronic daytime fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath, shallow breathing, inhaler prescription, two year history of productive cough with wheezing).

Further, given the nature of the Veteran's service (i.e., combat service in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War) with service treatment records documenting multiple respiratory complaints it is reasonable for the Board to find that he had problems with and/or symptoms of OSA and a respiratory disability during and since being exposed to environmental hazards in the air as well high levels of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and hexavalent chromium from burn pits while on active duty.

Entitlement to service connection for cause of the Veteran's death is granted. ### FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n1. The Veteran served in Qatar from May 2006 through September 2006 and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2007. 2. An August 2018 Certificate of Death shows that the Veteran died of massive weight loss and liver failure due to extensive metastatic carcinoma of the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes due to primary carcinoma of the pancreas. ### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n1. The criteria for service connection for pancreatic cancer are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1120, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 2.

The Veteran passed away in August 2018. The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse who has been properly substituted as a claimant for the service connection claims pending at the time of the Veteran's death. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2018 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). This matter was previously before the Board in February 2020. The claim was remanded for the RO to provide VA examination opinions.

Stegall v. West, 11 Vet.

Service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d). In addition, for certain chronic diseases, a presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). When a chronic disease is not shown within one year after service, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) for the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity. ---\nand  sufficient    observation    to  establish    chronicity    at the   time.

There is no evidence in the medical literature that establishes that pancreatic cancer is due to methylene chloride, perchorethylene, petroleum distillate, methyl ethyl keton, toluene, or lead chromate. Per medical literature, pancreatic cancer is due to mutated cells that grow out of control, forming a tumor. The exact cause is not known, certain risk factors are strongly linked to the disease, including tobacco smoking and obesity.

There had been studies conducted to evaluate cancer risk from DDVP (2,2-Dichloroethenyl dimethyl phosphate) exposure among pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS). The AHS used a cohort of 57,311 pesticide applicators in North Carolina and Iowa, enrolled from 1993-1997 and followed for cancer through 2004. A comprehensive questionnaire collected information on exposure to DDVP and potential confounders. Among the 49,762 licensed pesticide applicators eligible for analysis, 4,613 reported use of DDVP.

As noted above, under 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1), compensation is warranted for a Persian Gulf veteran who exhibits objective indications of a \"qualifying chronic disability. \" To constitute a \"qualifying\" chronic disability, the chronic disability must not be attributed to any known clinical disease by history, physical examination, or laboratory tests. See 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1). Although the Veteran participated in the Gulf War, because he had an actual diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, the presumptive service connection provisions regarding Gulf War veterans are not for application. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (providing the basis for presumptive service connection for veterans with undiagnosed illnesses who served during the Gulf War with symptoms such as fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, and abnormal weight loss). The Board is also unable to grant service connection on a direct basis because the evidence of record does not show that the claimed disability was incurred in or aggravated by military service. The record does not show that the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was diagnosed within one year of service, and the Veteran did not contend that he has experienced symptoms associated with pancreatic cancer continuously since separation. No treatment provider has opined that the Veteran's pancreatic cancer was directly due to his period of service. Therefore, the evidence does not show that direct service connection is warranted. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for pancreatic cancer on a presumptive basis under 38 U.S.C. § 1120 is warranted. See PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

Service connection for the cause of a Veteran's death requires a showing of (1) the existence of a service-connected disability, and (2) a causal relationship, either principle or contributory, between the disability and the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312. Generally, to establish that there was a service-connected disability there must be competent evidence showing: (1) the Veteran suffered from a disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the claimed disability and the in-service injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The death of a Veteran will be considered as having been due to a service-connected disability when the evidence establishes that such disability was either the principal or a contributory cause of death. The issue involved will be determined by exercise of sound judgment, without recourse to speculation, after a careful analysis has been made of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of the Veteran, including, particularly,\n---\nautopsy reports. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(a). A service-connected disability will be considered as the principal, or primary, cause of death when such disability, singly or jointly with some other condition, was the immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related thereto. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b). A contributory cause of death is inherently one not related to the principal cause. In determining whether the service-connected disability contributed to death, it must be shown that it contributed substantially or materially; that it combined to cause death; or that it aided or lent assistance to the production of death. It is not sufficient to show that it casually shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a causal connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(1); see also Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran's August 2018 death certificate identifies the immediate cause of death as massive weight loss and liver failure due to extensive metastatic carcinoma of the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes due to primary carcinoma of the pancreas. Extensive venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli were identified as significant conditions. At the time of his passing, the Veteran was service-connected for tinnitus, exercise-induced bronchial asthma, bilateral lower extremity varicose veins, degenerative disc disease, moderate chondromalacia, allergic rhinitis, left knee scars, and primary insomnia. An August 2020 VA examination report indicated review of the Veteran's claims file, recounted the Veteran's history, and recited his complaints. The examiner opined it is less likely than not that the Veteran's service-connected varicose veins contributed substantially or materially to the Veteran's death. It was reasoned: the varicose veins and superficial thrombophlebitis did not play a role in the development of the veteran's DVT and did not contribute to the veteran's death...The pancreatic cancer was the root cause of the veteran's death. The DVT almost certainly arose due to complications of that disease or treatment. The claimant specified the Veteran's case is not routine. Unfortunately, this sequence of events is not uncommon, as malignancy is a leading cause of DVT. Relatively speaking, the superficial thrombophlebitis is a minor condition and more likely than not played no role in the Veteran's decline or death.

Since the last final decision in January 2004 regarding the bilateral knee condition, cesarean section, and back trouble, the claims file includes evidence which relates to unestablished facts necessary to substantiate the claims of entitlement to service connection, and, if presumed credible, raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claims. 3. The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations after August 2, 1990, and developed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to a compensable degree. 4. The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations after August 2, 1990, and is therefore presumed to have toxic exposure; she developed left breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. ## CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n1. The January 2004 rating decision denying service connection for a bilateral knee condition, cesarean section, and back trouble is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1103. 2. Since the last final decision in January 2004 regarding the bilateral knee condition, cesarean section, and back trouble, new and material evidence has been received to warrant reopening of the claim of service connection for a bilateral knee condition, cesarean section, and back trouble. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5108, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. 3.

In January 2023, VA reported that the Department of Defense (DOD) confirmed that the Veteran met the definition of a \"Persian Gulf Veteran\" as specified by 38 U.S.C. § 1117. DOD Gulf War Veterans Information System (GWVIS) confirmed that the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2), for at least one day between August 2, 1990, through July 31, 1991. In addition, in a December 2022 memorandum, VA reported that DoD confirmed that the Veteran had presumptive toxic exposure based on such service, as per 38 U.S.C. § 1119. By way of procedural background, as will be discussed below, the Veteran's service-\n---\nconnection claims for a bilateral knee disability, for a back disability and for cesarean sections were denied in a January 2004 rating decision, which became final. In a December 2013 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) addressed each of the issues listed on the first page above, to include whether CUE existed in the January 2004 rating decisions to deny service connection.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"5761ae7c-dd3b-44c7-a42d-0476fda00dce":{"id_":"5761ae7c-dd3b-44c7-a42d-0476fda00dce","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"861fb4c3-70e2-4823-adaf-3411a970cc41","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"lMArRtqJ5vTRQFDlmqbbclvNhTutV0Di5779L8xioKY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"ede673e6-171f-4b0e-bafd-ee6af8060a97","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"w9sTE8TrI1sn/y0wZhR+JxswfnMgI3Q/hcZa9pjlWiE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"912ebc29-17a7-42f1-b614-674ab16f73ea","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"P4bTDM+PiRY5xLvZfJC98zWte7ripWQsd4XZn2V0ZfY="}},"hash":"DiXUVMfUiDYvxx6QIFqyn4dNcD0W6ccdEQYNtNML2fs=","text":"Within one year, in June 2014, the Veteran submitted a typewritten statement addressing all decisions made in the December 2013 rating decision, articulating reasons why the decisions were incorrect, and asking the AOJ for \"reconsideration,\" to include consideration of additionally submitted evidence. Because VA's current requirement that a Notice of Disagreement be filed on a specific form prescribed by the Secretary was not in effect in June 2014, the Board will accept the June 2014 correspondence as a timely Notice of Disagreement with each of the issues denied in the December 2013 rating decisions, to include the CUE claims. Insofar as the Veteran has asserted that the AOJ committed CUE in the December 2013 rating decision, such assertions are misplaced, as the December 2013 rating decision has not become final, by dint of this appeal. The Board notes that in an August 2019 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted entitlement to service connection for a total hysterectomy; therefore, that issue is no longer on appeal. Applications to Reopen Previously Denied Claims\n\nIf a claim of entitlement to service connection has previously been denied and that decision became final, the claim can be reopened and reconsidered only if new and material evidence is presented with respect to that claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5108. New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision-makers. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). The evidence VA is required to review for newness and materiality is that which has been submitted by the claimant since the last final disallowance of the claim on any basis. See Evans v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 273 (1996). The prior evidence of record is important in determining newness and materiality for the purposes of deciding whether to reopen a claim. For the purpose of determining whether a case should be reopened, the credibility of the evidence added to the record is to be presumed.

Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1992). The threshold for determining whether new and material evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim is low. See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 117 (2010). Furthermore, in determining whether this low threshold is met, the VA should not limit its consideration to whether the newly submitted evidence relates specifically to the reason why the claim was last denied, but instead should ask whether the evidence could reasonably substantiate the claim were the claim to be reopened, to include activating the Secretary's duty to assist. Shade, 24 Vet. App. at 118. New and material evidence having been received, the claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral knee condition, cesarean section, and back trouble are reopened. In a January 2004 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition, cesarean section, and back trouble finding that current chronic bilateral knee and back disabilities were not shown. Also, there was no permanent residual or chronic disability subject to service connection regarding the Veteran's in-service cesarean sections. The Veteran did not file a Notice of Disagreement with the January 2004 rating decisions and no new and material evidence was received within the appeal period. Therefore, the decision is final. ---\nIn January 2013, the Veteran filed a new claim seeking to reopen the underlying claims for right and left knee conditions, residuals of a cesarean section, and back trouble. Since the last final decision, in February 2022, the Veteran's representative reported that the Veteran suffered from complications of the in-service cesarean section, including lower abdominal scars and gynecological complications. Treatment records also show treatment for knee pain, and the April 2019 VA examinations included such diagnoses as lumbosacral strain as well as right and left knee retropatellar pain. The Veteran reported that during service she began to experience pain behind both knees during running exercises. She stated that she was seen by medical staff at that time and placed on profile along with pain medication. She claimed that she continued to experience pain to the back of her knee. She also reported that since the in-service fall from a tree, she continued to have periodic lower back pain.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"69449924-fdd7-44c7-91fd-bd3433b35fee":{"id_":"69449924-fdd7-44c7-91fd-bd3433b35fee","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"861fb4c3-70e2-4823-adaf-3411a970cc41","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"lMArRtqJ5vTRQFDlmqbbclvNhTutV0Di5779L8xioKY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"912ebc29-17a7-42f1-b614-674ab16f73ea","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"P4bTDM+PiRY5xLvZfJC98zWte7ripWQsd4XZn2V0ZfY="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"92e1d547-80aa-474f-845d-34aab5f86486","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"k0XrEfXJbYPLqjucMEifa1X19wm3pqUmNmwCJNBfEGE="}},"hash":"hHpRU+QAFBg+Tvk5JzbuaHs45kX5uM/DeqMX8+O0DPg=","text":"This evidence is new as it was not before adjudicators at the time of the prior final decision in January 2004; it is also material as it supports elements of service connection missing at the time of the prior decision. Accordingly, the claims for service connection for a bilateral knee condition, cesarean section, and back trouble are reopened. Service Connection - IBS\n\nAs noted above, the Department of Defense has confirmed that the Veteran had service in Southwest Asia, and is a Persian Gulf Veteran as defined by statute. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, functional gastrointestinal disorders, to specifically include IBS, are presumed to be service connected for Persian Gulf Veterans if manifested to a compensable degree after service. Here, a November 2014 VA examiner confirmed the presence of IBS manifesting in alternating constipation and diarrhea and weight loss, and requiring continuous medication. Given the Veteran's verified Persian Gulf service and post-service IBS diagnosis, service-connection for IBS is presumed under the law. The benefit sought on appeal is granted. Service Connection - Breast Cancer\n\nOn August 10, 2022, the President signed into law the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022. Among other things, defined which veterans may be presumed to have been exposed to burn pits and other toxins, and identified disabilities that may be presumed to be related to such exposures. Here, the DoD has confirmed the Veteran's toxic exposure, to include burn pits, as identified under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1119 by dint of her service in the Persian Gulf after August 2, 1990. See the December 3, 2022 VA Memorandum. Under 38 U.S.C. § 1120, reproductive cancers of any type are presumed to be related to such exposure. The Secretary has identified breast cancer as a type of reproductive cancer for the purposes of this presumption. VBA Letter 20-22-10, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022). The Veteran was diagnosed with left breast cancer in 2012. Accordingly, service-connection for breast cancer is presumed.

REASONS FOR REMAND\n\nEntitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disability, to include mood and depressive disorder, glaucoma and residuals of frostbite in fingers and toes is remanded. Regarding the psychiatric disability, in a February 2022 informal hearing presentation, the Veteran's representative indicated that the Veteran had a longstanding history of depression symptomatology since her time in the Army and that she was diagnosed with depression shortly after her service. Service treatment records show that the Veteran was referred to a mental status evaluation in October 1989 with no identified psychiatric disorder. Post-service treatment records reflect a diagnosis of depression in April 2001. Regarding glaucoma, in a February 2022 informal hearing presentation, the Veteran's representative reported that the Veteran's glaucoma began developing during service and not in the four years between her getting out and when it was mentioned in 2001. Service treatment records show that in March 1980, the Veteran's left eye was red due to viral conjunctivitis.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"78816d6c-e085-4bc7-ad76-b6bea2d014f0":{"id_":"78816d6c-e085-4bc7-ad76-b6bea2d014f0","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"861fb4c3-70e2-4823-adaf-3411a970cc41","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"lMArRtqJ5vTRQFDlmqbbclvNhTutV0Di5779L8xioKY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"92e1d547-80aa-474f-845d-34aab5f86486","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"k0XrEfXJbYPLqjucMEifa1X19wm3pqUmNmwCJNBfEGE="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"04e9660b-4091-46b3-9be9-361ee38dbea1","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23029924.pdf"},"hash":"KXhUx3POM5ywzMbVL5yMgQ7j5K4d/cwgHjJkQMae7vQ="}},"hash":"OOS7sWGuSjGHj4ExDLwXEqz0JVlrryPKkYNPttKnZcc=","text":"In July 1983, she had complaints of epiphora and pruritis of the eyes.

An April 2001 record included a diagnosis of glaucoma. Regarding residuals of frostbite, in a February 2022 informal hearing presentation, the Veteran's representative reported that the Veteran developed frostbite in her fingers and toes due to cold weather exposure during her service. She still continued to experience residuals of her frostbite and developed a painful left antecubital lump. She experienced intermittent numbness/tingling in her fingers and was diagnosed with hypesthesia in March 2010. Service treatment records documented swollen fingers with a fever in January 1982. She had equal swelling in her feet by at the end of the day that was resolved with elevation in January 1994. Post-service, March 2010 private treatment records noted complaints of tenderness and occasional numbness in the hand that impacted the distribution of the median nerve and the 1st through 3rd digits. The impression was that she had a lipomatous mass with sensation of numbness and possible nerve compression. She underwent an excision of left arm (antecubital) lipoma. The Veteran has not been afforded VA examinations addressing the nature and etiology of a psychiatric disorder, residuals of frostbite, and glaucoma. VA is obliged to provide an examination when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, the record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with active service; and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v.

Service treatment records show that the Veteran underwent x-rays in March 1982 to rule out a right knee fracture after she injured her right knee when she fell over a tree while participating in war games. There was an apparent soft tissue density adjacent to the medial aspect of the distal third of the femur most likely representing an artifact. A January 1995 radiologic report noted that the Veteran was seen to rule out Baker's cyst. No evidence of mass lesions was shown within the popliteal fossa. In March 1997, the Veteran had complaints of bilateral knee pain for one month duration. She reported sharp pain while going up the stairs and her knees occasionally \"give out\". She was given a provisional diagnosis of retropatellar pain syndrome. The Veteran was diagnosed with right and left knee retropatellar pain during and April 2019 VA examination.

During an April 2019 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with neck strain. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current neck condition was less likely than not related to service. The examiner reasoned that there was no evidence in records supporting a chronic condition of \"stiff neck. \" The examiner added that although it appeared that Veteran may be experiencing a current cervical strain, it had been 21 years since her separation from service, which would make this condition less likely than not caused by her time in service.

The Board notes that it has granted entitlement to service connection for IBS in this decision. However, it is possible the Veteran has other abdominal trauma or distress disabilities present other than IBS, given the medical assessments of record. As such the issue of entitlement to service connection for an abdominal trauma disability other than IBS remains on appeal. ## Department of Defense Confirmation\n\nIn January 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) confirmed that the Veteran met the definition of a \"Persian Gulf Veteran\" as specified by 38 U.S.C. § 1117. DOD Gulf War Veterans Information System (GWVIS) confirmed that the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2), for at least one day between August 2, 1990, through July 31, 1991.

The records detail various complaints and diagnoses over the years related to abdominal pain, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, and fatigue. ## Fatigue and Chronic Conditions\n\nRegarding fatigue, the Veteran experienced whole body fatigue dating back to her service. She sought help for her fatigue but never received an official diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. Her breast cancer treatment and IBS exacerbated her fatigue symptoms. ## VA Examination\n\nDuring the January 2015 VA examination, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's current condition fit the criteria for a diagnosis of chronic fatigue. ---\nsyndrome nor was their evidence in the record of such a diagnosis.

Regarding stomach trauma, in a February 2022 informal hearing presentation, the representative reported that the Veteran was treated for abdominal complaints in service. She developed irritable bowel syndrome due to stomach issues and abdominal trauma during service. She was given stool softeners during service and received continuous treatment ever since. In July 2001, she suffered an abdominal wall hernia containing the bowel, and subsequently treated for nondistended bowel loop. A 2005 examiner diagnosed her with ileus. The representative reported that the Veteran's bowel could not contract normally to remove waste from her body, which caused abdominal pain that could only be relieved by bowel movements, passing gas, or belching. Post-service treatment records from Tuomey Healthcare System show treatment for abdominal pain diagnosed as ileus in June and August 2005. A March 2010 record noted a history of an abdominoplasty.

Regarding sinusitis, in a February 2022 informal hearing presentation, the representative reported that the Veteran's sinusitis began in 1980 when she experienced nasal congestion, headaches, sneezing, and a runny nose.

Entitlement to service connection for frequent urination is remanded. In a February 2022 informal hearing presentation, the representative claimed that the Veteran's frequent urination was a complication of her symptomatic fibroids that manifested during service and resulted in a total hysterectomy. The representative indicated that the Veteran's fibroids became bigger and compressed her bladder resulting in frequent urination. Her voiding dysfunction/urinary incontinence was a side effect of her service-connected hysterectomy.

The Veteran has not been diagnosed with cancer in the head as a current disorder, and there are no residuals of salivary gland tumor surgery and radiation therapy that occurred in 2012. 2. The Veteran has not been diagnosed with cancer in the neck as a current disorder, and there are no residuals of salivary gland tumor surgery and radiation therapy that occurred in 2012. 3. The Veteran's diabetes mellitus type 2 did not manifest during service or to a compensable degree within one year of service separation; there was no continuity of symptomatology from service or the year following service; and the disorder is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease, to include any toxic exposure. 4. The Veteran's peripheral neuropathy is caused by her diabetes mellitus type 2, which is not service connected; the disorder was not incurred during service and is not otherwise related to a disease or injury of service. ### CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\n1.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2017 rating decision. The Board remanded this matter in April 2019. The Veteran is not currently service-connected for any disability. Service Connection\n---\nService connection will be granted for a current disability that resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated during active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be presumed for certain diseases, including diabetes mellitus, organic diseases of the nervous system, and nephritis, if the chronic disease is shown as such during service or within a presumptive period following service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309. For the listed chronic conditions, service connection may also be established by a continuity of symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, is presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"78cb86da-94ca-4c4f-bd15-595636d7b561":{"id_":"78cb86da-94ca-4c4f-bd15-595636d7b561","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"88afa499-d8c0-4a73-93ca-f6aaf1d7ec46","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"hash":"IZmwgqVU2/F1vVmqghKnu4orlC8WWJXnWn37gITls5M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"b67a3fd6-de8f-4fc1-8362-7c2f789b06ee","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"hash":"+y6qenLoqibTxvzYG4QHtb8qywjNOywZTLJ20Ry9ET0="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9853e044-4e5d-42ed-9027-6cb99c18f1a9","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"hash":"SbrqlDobQc6SGAgoIfjFDeAn6mg8PNSYPAetPO5Ki28="}},"hash":"z9Yp578vvpact+0Q686VvbT1PqFS1PxkQDdYJkCaOFg=","text":"38 C.F.R. § 3.307. Furthermore, if a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, certain diseases are presumed to be service connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6) are met, even though there is no record of the disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). VA has also conceded herbicide exposure for veterans who served in units that operated in or near the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iv). Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury. Any increase in severity of a non-service-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the non-service-connected disease, will be service-connected. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998). The scope of a disability claim includes any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). The claimant will be given the benefit of the doubt as to any issue material to the determination of a matter when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Regardless of legal presumptions relating to service connection, service connection may be established by adequate evidence of actual causation. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed.

Service connection for neck cancer. In January 2017, the Veteran filed a claim seeking service connection for head and neck cancer, alleging that the disorders are due to exposure to chemicals and herbicide agents while stationed at Fort McClellan, Alabama for basic training. A rating decision of June 2017 denied service connection for head cancer and for neck cancer. A notice of disagreement (NOD) and VA Form 9 were filed by the Veteran in July 2017 and January 2018, respectively. No cancer symptoms are noted in the service treatment records. The separation examination report of August 1979 found the Veteran to be normal with respect to the head, face, neck, and scalp. The Veteran does not allege an in-service onset of cancer. Treatment records of Dr. B. P., dated March 2017, note the following diagnoses and dates: neoplasm UPB larynx and neoplasm UB oral cavity pharynx (December 2011); neoplasm, malignant, salivary gland NOS (February 2012); and mucositis due to radiation therapy (July 2012).

There were currently no residual neck problems and no neck involvement. The examination report made no current cancer diagnosis. The only diagnosis was the salivary gland cancer in 2012 with no current residuals. In March 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for oral and dental conditions. The report noted a 2012 diagnosis of status post polymorphous carcinoma surgical removal, in remission. The condition had resolved following the surgery and radiation therapy. The Veteran had a history of salivary gland cancer but no current cancer disorder. The Veteran, as a layperson, is competent to report symptoms as they are experienced through the senses. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). She is not competent to diagnose cancer. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011). The requirement of a current disability is satisfied if a disorder is diagnosed at the time a claim is filed or at any time during the pendency of the appeal. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). In the Veteran's case, there is no competent evidence of head or neck cancer as a current disorder.

In February 2023, diabetes mellitus type 2 and diabetic peripheral neuropathy were diagnosed by VA examination. The noted onset year of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 2015. No onset date was given for the Veteran's diabetes. Diabetes is not noted in the service treatment records. For the separation examination report of August 1979, the Veteran has found to be normal with respect to the endocrine system. The laboratory findings were negative for albumin and sugar, and diabetes was not diagnosed.

Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). The Veteran alleges that the Monsanto Company produced cancer-causing PCBs in Anniston, Alabama, that herbicide agents for which VA grants presumptive service connection status were used at Fort McClellan, that other dangerous pesticides and herbicides were used and spilled at Fort McClellan, and that trichloroethane (TCD) has been found in groundwater near one of the base's landfills.

No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022), requires that VA conduct an epidemiological study on the health trends of veterans who served at Fort McClellan. The new law does not create a presumption of exposure at Fort McClellan or a presumption for service connection for any Fort McClellan exposure. VA's regulations do not identify Fort McClellan as an exposure area for toxic substances, including herbicide agents. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6), an \"herbicide agent\" is defined as the chemicals 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T and its contaminant TCDD, cacodylic acid, and Picloram. The presumption of service connection based on exposure to an herbicide agent is expressly limited in the regulation, as the Veteran acknowledges, to situations in which the requirements of § 3.307(a)(6) are met. Because the latter section does not refer to any herbicide exposure at Fort McClellan, exposure is not presumed. Despite the lack of an herbicide presumption associated with service at Fort McClellan, service connection may be established upon sufficient evidence of actual causation by an herbicide agent or other toxic exposure.

In the report, Dr. Mathers states that, in her professional opinion as a weed scientist, it is more likely than not and reasonably certain that persons serving or living at Fort McClellan between 1974 and 1978 were exposed to the same herbicide agents used in Vietnam and likely received more exposure to contaminants such as TCDD than those with Vietnam service, especially anyone undergoing any kind of military training conducted outside. Dr. Mathers has concluded that the herbicide agents used at Fort McClellan contained the same agents as those used in Vietnam, namely 2, 4D, 2,4,5-T, and TCDD, Picloram, etc. While limiting her \"reasonable degree of certainty finding\" to the years 1974 to 1976, she states that the years of service are not specifically limited and may go beyond 1976.

There was allegedly a mustard gas spill in 1961, when leaky containers were transported though the base, dripping mustard on the transport vehicle and the pavement.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"a13ddd3f-12d2-4099-89c1-516e5d3a124f":{"id_":"a13ddd3f-12d2-4099-89c1-516e5d3a124f","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"88afa499-d8c0-4a73-93ca-f6aaf1d7ec46","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"hash":"IZmwgqVU2/F1vVmqghKnu4orlC8WWJXnWn37gITls5M="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"53d5aced-dc73-4c77-a202-2c55e815f9f2","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"hash":"/8+mEF1EmU85J0omXHA8RrSM1g7vjvuNRyuFVx7ukQc="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"558e00bf-1878-45ba-8e7c-064388d6e500","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/23040378.pdf"},"hash":"0WsVBehn1oPnWkMcxkklnYGl3d46xDhM7CXjWi/WYgg="}},"hash":"gL94gRL9ei+FReIz40wExx1s5F8/DOTX2+e/nq5o1pI=","text":"A non-commissioned officer reported that a 55-gallon drum of mustard gas was buried in a \"Toxic Agent Yard. \"\n\nThe Mathers report states that radiological material, including the radioactive isotopes cobalt and cesium, were used at Fort McClellan and that several areas have the \"potential\" for radiological contamination.

In March 2020, VA's Compensation Service reviewed the Department of Defense's (DOD's) listing of locations outside of Vietnam and the Korean DMZ where Agent Orange was used, tested, or stored. DoD has not identified Fort McClellan as a location where Agent Orange was used, tested, or stored. In addition, no evidence associates Agent Orange (developed for combat operations in Vietnam and was used there from 1962 to early 1971) with the US Army Chemical School or the Chemical-Biological-Radiological Agency (CBR) at Fort McClellan. Furthermore, Fort McClellan was not on the Agent Orange shipping supply line running directly from Gulfport, Mississippi to South Vietnam via merchant ships.

In short, other Board decisions, which are not precedential, were necessarily based upon different records of evidence. The Board must base its decision on the record before it and not those of other appeals that may share some elements of the Veteran's case. For the same reason, the Board will not rely upon prior Board decisions which determined that the claimant was exposed to a commercial herbicide, not an herbicide agent as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(i)), when stationed at Fort McClellan, Alabama.

The clinician explained that there would need to be a massive exposure event (not shown in the Veteran's records) to even consider the contention as being at least as likely as other causes. Moreover, the necessary exposure would have to involve a degree of direct contact, such as having the chemicals directly sprayed on or ingested, that is not noted in the Veteran's case. Further explanation was that the Veteran's age group of the late 50s to 60s commonly has these disorders, that the Veteran was a heavy tobacco smoker with a history of 40+ pack years, and that the Veteran's mother had diabetes (familial history). In December 2022, a response was received from a researcher of the Veteran's Benefits Administration, Office of Field Operations, Military Records Research Centers. A review of an unredacted 2019 DOD Tactical Herbicide Location list failed to verify herbicide exposure of the Veteran while assigned to Company D, Women's Army Corp Training Brigade, US Women's Army Corps Center, Fort McClellan, Alabama from June 28, 1972, to August 24, 1972, as claimed by the Veteran. No evidence documented the claimed exposure incident/event. A further VA nexus opinion based on records review was obtained in February 2023. In the clinician's opinion, the Veteran's type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy are less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), namely unconfirmed, possible exposure to mustard gas in boot camp as a patch or droplet (single) and unconfirmed exposure to PCBs in a town near Fort McClellan, after considering the total, potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The rationale was that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type 2 is a metabolic disease that is very common in the Veteran's age group and is related to heredity and metabolism.

The opinion was based on a review of the current claims folder at the time, which included the Mathers report. Although VA must afford a claimant the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in relative equipoise, the claimant has the evidentiary burden of establishing all elements of service connection, at least to the extent of equipoise, including a nexus to service. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (2009). In this case, the weight of the evidence, which is not in approximate balance, is against finding that the Veteran was actually exposed to an herbicide agent or other toxic substance when at Fort McClellan in 1972, including her visits to Anniston, Alabama, that her diabetes and diabetic peripheral neuropathy is caused by a disease or injury of service, or that the disorders had their onset during service. The Veteran is not competent to associate her current diabetes with the herbicide spraying that she witnessed on the base, to her training exercises, or to her visits to Anniston, Alabama. The Board also may not make its own, independent judgment as to medical questions. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991). The only competent nexus opinions of record attribute the Veteran's current disorders to heredity, metabolism, and other non-service causes.

Rating decisions were issued under the legacy system in October 2017 and July 2018. In October 2018, the Veteran opted into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) election form and selecting the higher-level review (HLR) lane. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a RAMP HLR decision in August 2019, which is the decision on appeal. In the September 2019 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the RAMP opt-in, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"c62ded85-beb6-4997-ab89-2b409b26badb":{"id_":"c62ded85-beb6-4997-ab89-2b409b26badb","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6a07b93b-255e-46d7-9a9f-c4a7874d2dcb","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"hash":"SP1HTiE8sFax/LrKEpidJpsSyoeIdt/k+T9XULicZj0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f64fb3ba-a48b-4eaa-a45d-5ceb2580fbc7","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"hash":"joTrbOQOZGYS0Hm/btBI3AqpZTCzQpIQGRFnab3H3cU="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"fb5547a3-32c9-4f78-b01d-34496e14b600","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"hash":"MWe1406H4RK1bciz2T7UuPbx2RPVEt1/+sJM4OIxzPA="}},"hash":"i7pLTLFVkNER+CzK27FlvN019SDfT48S0hDaDgJ/aZU=","text":"38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II\n4. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction\n5. Entitlement to service connection for hyperlipidemia\n6. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer\n\nService connection may be established for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110. To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: \"(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. \" Davidson v.

There is no evidence or contention that any such problems manifested within the presumptive period and, as such, entitlement to service connection based on the foregoing is not for application. The Veteran's service treatment records do not include complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to the claimed disabilities. The Veteran does not contend otherwise. After service, a May 1973 x-ray showed an essentially normal heart. In December 2008, the Veteran underwent a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Records also document coronary atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, and hyperlipidemia. A July 2015 prostate biopsy showed invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate. ---\nA February 2017 bone scan was worrisome for active bony metastatic disease of the left ischium. A September 2017 VA prostate cancer examination report documented prostate cancer from July 2015. Following examination, the examiner concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the prostate cancer was related to exposure to herbicides. The rationale was that VA guidelines had established a presumption that prostate cancer was related to exposure to herbicides. In addition, the erectile dysfunction was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by prostate cancer because it was a well-known fact that prostate cancer could cause erectile dysfunction. A May 2018 private treatment record noted a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II. Prostate Cancer, Diabetes Mellitus, Heart Disability, and Erectile Dysfunction\n\nThe Veteran has diagnoses of prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, multiple heart disabilities, and erectile dysfunction. The Veteran does not allege that the disabilities began during service or otherwise were caused by service. No medical evidence suggests in-service onset.

Instead, the Veteran asserts that the disabilities were caused by his in-service exposure to herbicide agents during his service in Korea.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"2f28916e-d544-4916-b57a-a07861e46b63":{"id_":"2f28916e-d544-4916-b57a-a07861e46b63","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"6a07b93b-255e-46d7-9a9f-c4a7874d2dcb","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"hash":"SP1HTiE8sFax/LrKEpidJpsSyoeIdt/k+T9XULicZj0="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"fb5547a3-32c9-4f78-b01d-34496e14b600","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"hash":"MWe1406H4RK1bciz2T7UuPbx2RPVEt1/+sJM4OIxzPA="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"ab353072-0608-420b-ac8e-a1c06e6a7a46","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A22021117.pdf"},"hash":"NY4eKNM4ED1awN0YMSftWWMCaNcEYHe5AXvkgF6Gqwc="}},"hash":"t/y/r/M/LchLM+eK+9x6zUNzeoH345O4Bc4jGrY+eUc=","text":"With respect to service connection based on herbicide exposure, VA laws and regulation provide that a veteran who, during active military service, served between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit that, as determined by the Department of Defense, operated in or near the Korean DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied during that period, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iv).

A February 2005 letter from another fellow service member also noted that Agent Orange was stored at the ASCOM compound and was within the \"watershed of any and all land areas upon which the herbicides were applied. \" The letter also stated, \"I recall a building in the depot with barrels stacked up on the side of it.

The Veteran submitted Board decisions involving other veterans; however, these decisions involved different fact patterns, including different periods of service in Korea and/or service at different locations in Korea in addition to Camp Casey. In an April 2017 statement, the Veteran alleged that while at the NCO academy, \"As part of our training we conducted extensive field operations in and along the South Korean Demilitarized Zone in order to familiarize us with daily operational procedures where we conducted physical training exercises as well. On numerous occasions we were utilizing nearby natural water sources for hydration. The physical training conducted put us in direct contact within areas void of vegetation from being treated with growth retardant and herbicides as noted by the military command. \" The Veteran also alleged exposure to herbicide agents as part of his daily duties as a military police at his ASCOM duty station, including physically examining all storage and distribution warehouses and cargo exiting the ASCOM compound. The Veteran also patrolled areas devoid of vegetation, with herbicides sprayed by backpack sprayers. A July 2019 DPRIS response from the Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) noted examination of Company A, 728th Military Police Battalion unit records, which was located at Camp Hayes, ASCOM, Inchon City, Korea. The \"records do not document the use, storage, spraying or transporting of Agent Orange or other tactical herbicides. In addition, the records do not mention or document any specific duties performed by Co A, 728th MP BN unit members along the DMZ. \"\n\nDuring his April 2022 Board hearing, the Veteran described how around Camp Hayes in Korea there was very little grass or other vegetation. The Veteran reported observing the use of herbicides by Korean nationals spraying around the guard shack and gate where the Veteran was stationed. He could feel the mist hitting his face and hands and there was a foul taste in the Veteran's mouth. There were rice paddies immediately outside the base compound, so the Veteran believed herbicide use was limited to distribution by hand. He also witnessed the storage of Agent Orange on base, as \"this was a major distribution point for Agent Orange.

The Veteran also testified about service at Camp Casey that was 10 miles from the DMZ. He conducted training along the DMZ and used the water from streams in the area. The Veteran also discussed how his clothing was washed using water from local rivers. He also shared common areas with other service members who had been exposed to Agent Orange. A June 2022 statement from the Veteran contended that \"he was stationed and placed in locations, near water streams and fellow military that were sprayed (by hand or aerial) or contaminated by Herbicides know as Agent Orange. \"\n\nThe Company A, 728th Military Police Battalion unit is not recognized by the DOD as operating in the Korean DMZ during the qualifying period. ---\nConsequently, the Veteran must therefore demonstrate that he was actually present at or near the Korean DMZ during his period of time in the Republic of Korea in order to be afforded the presumption in this case.

The Veteran's personnel records document service at Camp Hayes and Camp Casey. The Board has considered the Veteran's contentions that while at the NCO Academy at Camp Casey, he had training along the DMZ. The Board finds such a contention credible and consistent with the evidence of record. As such, the presumptive provisions of section 3.309(e) are applicable. As prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease are on the list of presumptive disabilities under section 3.309(e), entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, coronary atherosclerosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus, type II, is warranted. As to the erectile dysfunction, the September 2017 VA examination report concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the erectile dysfunction was caused by the now service-connected prostate cancer.

Accordingly, the Veteran's claims for service connection for prostate cancer, coronary atherosclerosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, erectile dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus, type II, are granted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Bone Cancer\n\nAs to the Veteran's bone cancer claim, the evidence indicates that he had findings suggestive of active bony metastatic disease of the left ischium in 2017. No further findings confirming this diagnosis are of record. The Board notes that section 3.317 includes one type of bone cancer on the list of diseases presumptively due to exposure to herbicide agents, specifically multiple myeloma. By contrast, the Veteran's diagnosed metastatic bone disease or bone metastases are not included on the list of diseases that are presumptively service-connected, and the above evidence fails to document a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, soft-tissue sarcoma, or other disease listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). The Board has considered whether the Veteran's bony metastatic disease was equivalent to multiple myeloma, but the medical evidence does not contain documentation of a diagnosis of multiple myeloma or other cancer for which presumptive service connection is available under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). The Board also notes that in rare circumstances malignant fibrous histiocytoma could involve the bone, but that this cancer is listed only under soft tissue sarcoma for purposes of the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. In any case, as the evidence does not suggest a diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, a grant of service connection on a presumptive basis due to such disability is not warranted. As such, although exposure to Agent Orange has been presumed, presumptive service connection for exposure to herbicide agents is not warranted because the Veteran's active bony metastatic disease of the left ischium is not among the presumptively service-connected diseases. However, when a veteran is found not to be entitled to a regulatory presumption of service connection for a given disability, the claim must nevertheless be reviewed to determine whether service connection can be established on another basis.

For service connection to be granted on a direct basis, there must be evidence that links the Veteran's active bony metastatic disease of the left ischium to an in-service occurrence of an injury or disease, and competent evidence of a nexus between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. A review of Veteran's service treatment file does not reveal a diagnosis or treatment for any bone cancer or tumor-related issues in service. The Veteran does not contend otherwise. Additionally, there is nothing in the Veteran's post-service treatment records that reflects that he was diagnosed as having bone cancer within one year of service. The only evidence suggesting a link to service is the Veteran's own statements that the bone cancer was caused by exposure to Agent Orange. The Board does not doubt the Veteran is sincere in his belief that the bone cancer was caused by Agent Orange exposure during service. Although the Veteran may certainly describe his symptoms, he does not have the medical training necessary to render an opinion as to the origin and/or type(s) of the Veteran's bone cancer.

As\n---\nsuch, the Board finds no probative value in the Veteran's statements with regard to establishing service connection for bone cancer on a direct basis. There is no lay or medical evidence suggesting that the metastatic bone cancer metastasized from the prostate cancer or otherwise was caused or aggravated by the now service-connected prostate cancer or other service-connected disability. Cf. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. In light of the foregoing, the claim for entitlement to service connection for bone cancer must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see generally Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet.

Hyperlipidemia The Veteran also seeks service connection for hyperlipidemia. He contends that the condition is the result of the Veteran's active service. After carefully considering the record on appeal, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for entitlement to service connection for hyperlipidemia. The Board does not dispute that the Veteran has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia. However, hyperlipidemia and/or elevated cholesterol are not recognized as disabilities for VA compensation purposes. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(16), 105(a), 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c); see also 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996) (diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol are actually laboratory results and are not, in and of themselves, disabilities). The term \"disability\" as used for VA purposes refers to impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders v Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995). Notably, in this case, no disability manifested by hyperlipidemia has been demonstrated or alleged. Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in disability. Thus, in the absence of proof of a present disability upon which to predicate an award of service connection, there can be no valid claim. Accordingly, the claim for service connection for hyperlipidemia must be denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as no evidence supports the fundamental requirement of current disability in connection with this claim, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. PAULA B.

Regretfully, the Veteran passed away in September 2020. The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse who, in April 2021, was granted substitute claimant status by a VA agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) as to the Veteran's claims that were pending at the time of his death and sought service connection for his prostate cancer and chronic kidney disease. In addition, in her own capacity, the appellant applied for DIC benefits and burial benefits. This case comes to the Board on appeal from a July 2022 AOJ rating decision that confirmed and continued the denial of denied service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death and service connection for kidney failure and prostate cancer. The AOJ also denied burial benefits in the letter notifying the Veteran of the service connection denials. The Veteran timely appealed. Although the AOJ used the term accrued benefits, its grant of substitution to the appellant warrants characterization of the claims without the use of that term. Reliford v. McDonald,\n---\n27 Vet.

The AOJ conceded that the Veteran was indeed stationed at Camp Lejeune, and his period at Camp Lejeune fell within the August 1, 1953, to December 31, 1987, period of time. Nonetheless, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims for service connection for these disabilities upon pointing out that neither prostate cancer nor chronic kidney disease could be deemed service connected on a presumptive basis.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e8fdae8a-45fd-4a4a-a8e6-40728f24c79a":{"id_":"e8fdae8a-45fd-4a4a-a8e6-40728f24c79a","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23000516.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bb5fbead-3b50-47f6-a6d3-61be053da835","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23000516.pdf"},"hash":"qx5VP1GN713+SIyaPZfXfiJBSLmRLQRsv4Ui58598fk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"8dd922b4-c9a6-4559-b94c-4e0020f1e99b","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23000516.pdf"},"hash":"+uc60/s28lXEfFLqrSYPjb8FEHLQOAGS/VxGZzlUY6Q="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"f99d7447-a03b-40e9-9d6d-5ddd631a9415","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23000516.pdf"},"hash":"dI80KfWDFY0MkXXYmxhJPy4Of+dpYpQB+UrGHyqfbv4="}},"hash":"XL87wPhHfELl/heiHBgkCUNUqIK/q3WFT2ML+LuXPGc=","text":"Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to contaminants (defined as the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE or PERC), benzene, and vinyl chloride) in the on-base water supply located at Camp Lejeune, even if there is no record of such disease during service, provided that these diseases manifest to a compensable degree at any time after service at the U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and/or Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina, during the period from August 1, 1953, to December 31, 1987. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(7). Only the following diseases are deemed associated with exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune: kidney cancer, liver cancer, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, adult leukemia, multiple myeloma, Parkinson's disease, aplastic anemia and other myelodysplastic syndromes, and bladder cancer. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f). Neither prostate cancer nor chronic kidney disease is among the diseases for which VA has specifically determined a presumption of service connection is warranted.

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things, i.e., current disability, an in-service event, and a causal relationship between the current disability and such an event. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Therefore, the sole missing element of both claims for direct service connection purposes was that of causal relationship, or nexus. Here, in June 2022, the appellant submitted an April 2022 medical opinion of Dr. C.K. Dr. C.K.'s opinion provided a thorough discussion of contaminants that, for VA purposes, were indisputably present in Camp Lejeune water during the Veteran's period of active service, an equally thorough discussion of the Veteran's medical conditions, to include his coronary conditions and diabetes mellitus, type II, as well as their side effects, such as the Veteran's obesity, as well as a thoughtful analysis of the causal relation between the Veteran's consumption of Camp Lejeune water and his prostate cancer and chronic kidney disease. Basing his opinion on current medical literature and the Veteran's medical history, Dr. C.K. opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's exposure to contaminants present in water of Camp Lejeune either caused or, at the very least, contributed to his prostate cancer and chronic kidney disease.

Indeed, Dr. C.K.'s reliance on medical literature was duly limited to utilizing general medical science for the purposes of assessing the Veteran's unique medical circumstances. Accordingly, the Board agrees with the appellant that the July 2022 VA examiner's opinion warrants allocation of lower probative value than the opinion of Dr. C.K. In addition, the record before the Board includes a competent, credible, and probative opinion of the June 2017 VA examiner as to his claim for service connection for chronic kidney disease, as well as the Veteran's VA medical treatment records addressing his kidney disease and prostate cancer. The June 2017 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with chronic renal disorder stating that, by June 2017, the Veteran was experiencing stage III renal failure, with symptoms detected accidentally during a laboratory technician's review of the Veteran's blood test in June 2006. The VA examiner also stated that the Veteran's chronic kidney disease caused him to severely limit his daily water intake to accommodate his failing kidneys, exercise extreme caution with taking medications, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. The May 2017 VA examiner also acknowledged the Veteran's diabetes diagnosed in 1985 and hypertension diagnosed in 1990 and observed that the Veteran's renal failure was amplifying the severity of each of these conditions, rather than being caused by either of these conditions or any other disability that the Veteran was experiencing at the time.

For the above reasons, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's prostate cancer and kidney disease are related to his exposure to Camp Lejeune contaminated water.

See 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b). For a service-connected disability to be deemed a contributory cause of a veteran's death, it must be shown that it contributed substantially or materially, combined to cause death, and aided or lent assistance to the production of death. Thus, it is not sufficient to show that it just \"shared\" in producing death; rather, it must be shown that there was a causal connection. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(1); Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet.

And while the July 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran's coronary condition was among causes of his stage III renal failure, rather than vice-versa, the Board finds the opinions of Dr. C.K., May 2017 VA examiner, and the Veteran's treating medical practitioners more probative. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran's service-connected renal failure was not the primary but qualified as a contributory cause of the Veteran's death within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(1). Thus, entitlement to DIC benefits based on the cause of the Veteran's death is warranted.

Specifically, VA eliminated the then-existing regulations, i.e., 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1600 through 3.1612, and replaced them with new regulations renumbered as 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1700 through 3.1713. See 79 Fed. Reg. 32,653-32,662 (June 6, 2014) (codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1700 through 3.1713). While both rules are equally favorable to the appellant, the Board notes that the final rule is applicable to claims for burial benefits pending on or after July 7, 2014, i.e., it governs the appellant's claim at bar since the Veteran passed away in 2000. If a veteran dies as a result of a service-connected disability or disabilities, burial benefits should be paid. 38 U.S.C. § 2307; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1704(b).","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"e21621b7-6980-4d4d-9a41-d3cd7ac43bf2":{"id_":"e21621b7-6980-4d4d-9a41-d3cd7ac43bf2","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23000516.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"bb5fbead-3b50-47f6-a6d3-61be053da835","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23000516.pdf"},"hash":"qx5VP1GN713+SIyaPZfXfiJBSLmRLQRsv4Ui58598fk="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"5dc22e23-5591-441a-8164-c589e51051fd","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23000516.pdf"},"hash":"dc5TFfdgcDVYAEej2ePmBgNVdJ96jxKdnjyNtsuWvWg="}},"hash":"ClQCPa+etuXSXNf9GjozLz2F1048miHYkJOVkBL3dCY=","text":"§ 2307; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1704(b).

Accordingly, new and relevant evidence has been received in order to readjudicate the service connection claims on appeal, and the petition to readjudicate these claims is granted. Service Connection\n\nWith regard to the claims on appeal, the Veteran asserts exposure to herbicides and insecticides while stationed in Thailand. See May 2020 Claim and November 2022 Board Hearing Transcript. His military personnel records show he served in the Army and was stationed at Camp Essayons, Thailand, from June 1967 to June 1968. See also, January 2021 Research Response. His military occupational specialty (MOS) was cook. During the Board hearing, the Veteran testified that while at Camp Essayons, his duties required him to leave his base approximately two to three times per week to deliver food to troops who were building a supply route. He also testified that his work and living area was within 100 meters of the perimeter. In addition, during this time, he reported observing chemicals for mosquitos being sprayed three times per week which created a fog, and that he had trouble breathing and felt nauseous after spraying occurred. He further testified that he occasionally traveled to Korat RTAFB approximately 25 times in 22 months, and his representative stated that he would have traveled across the base perimeter approximately 25 to 50 times. In a December 2022 Brief, the representative further asserted that service connection was warranted prior to enactment of the PACT Act as the Veteran had duties on or near the perimeter of his base. In this regard, the representative stated that the M21 manual did not provide a definition or specify distance related to \"near the perimeter\" and noted the Veteran had provided a written statement that he served near and went through the perimeter of multiple bases in Thailand.

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran did not serve in the Air Force. Additionally, he was not stationed at any of the designated RTAFBs. As such, the Board does not find herbicide exposure based on service in Thailand under the facts of this case. Even if the Board were to consider the Veteran's lay statements as to occasionally traveling to Korat RTAFB, VA specifically did not extend the presumption to all service members who served there (e.g. traveled through the gates to enter the base, or worked in view of the perimeter), but instead found it should be provided to those members whose duties actually placed them on the perimeter where they would come in contact with sprayed areas; the M21-1 provides examples of such service. Although the term \"near\" is not defined, based on the M21-1 examples of covered duties, the Board finds it is meant to convey duties which would require regular, routine, extensive, frequent, or prolonged presence on the edge of the base where spraying was used to control vegetation, as suggested by the \"evidence of daily work duties. \"\n\nIn this regard, the Veteran does not assert that his duties actually placed him on the perimeter during the occasions that he traveled to Korat RTAFB.

The Board has also considered statements that Camp Essayons was sprayed with herbicides, and that he had trouble breathing and felt nauseous after spraying occurred. However, with regard to lay statements of witnessing and/or experiencing the effects of herbicides being sprayed, the Board is unable to credit his reporting in this instance as he has provided conflicting statements in this matter. Specifically, in a July 2020 letter, he specifically reported that the Camp he witnessed being sprayed with herbicides was located in the Republic of Vietnam, not Thailand. The Veteran's reference to the camp being located in Vietnam was not a simple typographical error as that letter was submitted as evidence of service in Vietnam. The Board finds this discrepancy significant as it directly relates to the time and place of his reported herbicide exposure. Therefore, the Board provides no probative value to the Veteran's reporting in this regard. In any event, his lay statements as to in-service exposure to herbicides are speculative in nature and do not provide the requisite evidence as such does not show actual exposure to herbicide agents. Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36, 40 (2010) (holding that a layperson's assertions indicating exposure to gases or chemicals during service are not sufficient evidence alone to establish that such an event actually occurred during service; where the evidence has failed to establish an in-service injury, disease, or event, VA is not obligated to provide a medical examination). Accordingly, apart from the presumption of herbicide exposure provided by the PACT Act, the competent and credible evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving in Thailand. The Board is bound by VA law and regulations which do not provide for a presumption of herbicide exposure based on the circumstances of the Veteran's service, and the probative evidence of record does not reflect actual herbicide exposure. Without the benefit of the presumption of herbicide exposure contained in 38 C.F.R. ง 3.307(a)(6), the evidence must show that he was personally exposed to an \"herbicide agent\" as that term is defined in the regulation. However, the evidence of record is insufficient to show actual exposure to an herbicide agent during the Veteran's active duty service.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"666f037f-89c3-4997-8635-b39c1d0c16d9":{"id_":"666f037f-89c3-4997-8635-b39c1d0c16d9","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"b88f7dd7-4dd9-47b9-826e-b34e1e070437","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"hash":"yAA8HSggvaPiHclzYDM/b1/Ko6wK69xDi1vEKJRm9TY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"9cbbd4a4-a1b8-4143-a553-29ea99e7a6fd","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"hash":"jTyZKIlyhECl3JYzALLB3fWpHClN6PUsox5dDUR3FVs="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"70aebe85-ea1d-4a8c-9baa-7957eeb16e69","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"hash":"S7v1cntSZARYW2vVgOguSvP90BpR1n895H+T5WR9q5g="}},"hash":"tKtX4fTFGwaXK192jCP0iWkhZ3v51HJWW/ztnJaKhxQ=","text":"Entitlement to service connection for high cholesterol. ---\nHigh cholesterol is referred to as hypercholesterolemia or hyperlipidemia.

Hyperlipidemia is \"a general term for elevated concentrations of any or all of the lipids in the plasma, including hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, etc. \" Id. at 887. In this case, there is no lay or medical evidence suggesting that the Veteran's elevated cholesterol levels has resulted in any impairment in earning capacity during the appeal period. Instead, his hyperlipidemia are laboratory test findings. See 61 Fed.

The Board acknowledges that high cholesterol may be evidence of an underlying disability or may be a risk factor in the development of certain diseases, but service connection may not be granted for this condition alone, as it is not considered a \"disability\" for VA purposes. Importantly, the Veteran does not assert that his hypercholesterolemia has caused other diseases. Conversely, he submitted a November 2022 private opinion letter in which a physician asserted that his hypercholesterolemia was secondary to his diabetes. Specifically, the physician stated that diabetes caused elevated levels of insulin called hyperinsulinemia, and that elevated insulin levels substantially worsened the body's lipid profile and total cholesterol. Additionally, the physician stated that insulin resistance prevented the liver from producing more HDL \"good\" cholesterol, and allowed the liver to produce large levels of \"bad\" cholesterol and lipids.

Accordingly, the claim for service connection for hypercholesterolemia is denied. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension and diabetes. The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for hypertension and diabetes. Specifically, he asserts entitlement on the basis of herbicide and insecticide exposure. See May 2020 Claim and November 2022 Board Hearing Transcript. Initially, the Board notes that a review of the record, including the service treatment records (STRs) and lay statements, does not show that his hypertension or diabetes began during service or within one year following separation from service, or are otherwise related to service on a direct basis other than due to exposure to herbicides and insecticides. Therefore, entitlement to service connection on a basis other than herbicide or insecticide exposure is not warranted. The evidence of record shows the Veteran has been diagnosed with essential hypertension that is currently treated with prescription medication. See March 2020 Private Medical Record Received July 2020. A July 2020 VA examination also shows a diagnosis for diabetes mellitus II. With regard to herbicide exposure, the PACT Act added service in Thailand to the list of locations where servicemen and servicewomen were presumptively exposed to herbicide agents during the Vietnam era without regard to military occupational specialty (MOS). See Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-168, ง 403(d)(2) (2022). Thus, the criteria for presumptive service connection for diabetes mellitus are met and the claim is granted on this basis. Prior to the PACT Act, VA regulations did not provide hypertension as a presumptive disability associated with such exposure. However, the PACT Act does establish hypertension as a presumptive disease for in-service exposure to herbicide agents. The effective and applicability date for the inclusion of hypertension is October 1, 2026.

As noted above, without the presumption offered by the PACT Act, exposure to herbicides has not been conceded. Therefore, the remaining inquiry on appeal is whether the Veteran's hypertension and diabetes are etiologically related to insecticide exposure. In this regard, apart from the Veteran's assertion that he was exposed to insecticides, and that such exposure caused his hypertension and diabetes, he has not submitted or cited any medical treatise suggesting any such associations. As such, the Board finds that the mere assertion in this matter did not trigger VA's duty to assist in obtaining a medical opinion. Additionally, the Board affords no probative value to the Veteran's speculative and conclusory etiological statement as it is unsupported by any competent scientific evidence suggesting an etiological association. Therefore, absent any competent evidence that the Veteran's hypertension and diabetes are etiologically related to his service, without the presumptions of herbicide exposure pursuant to the PACT Act, entitlement to service connection must be denied.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for skin cancer on the basis of herbicide and insecticide exposure. See May 2020 Claim and November 2022 Board Hearing Transcript. The evidence of record includes STRs which are silent for any complaints, treatment or diagnosis for skin cancer. Additionally, his June 1968 separation examination noted normal skin and the Veteran denied having any skin diseases.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2020. He was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and psoriasis. He reported the onset of his skin conditions in 1995 with crusty sores that would not heal. He also reported having spots burned off and surgically removed, and that the spots reoccurred. During the November 2022 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he had been diagnosed with squamous cell skin cancer which was currently being treated. In this regard, he stated that he had lesions removed from his nose, forehead, behind his ears and on his jaw. He further testified that while he was stationed at Camp Essayons, Thailand, insecticides were sprayed three times per week, and that he experienced skin reactions following applications. In December 2022, the Veteran submitted a November 2022 letter from Dr. M.S. who stated the Veteran was exposed to herbicides during service, and that herbicides contained many carcinogenic compounds. One such compound, benzene, caused toxicity even where exposure levels were far below acceptable occupational exposure limits. In addition, the compound TCDD was noted to be known as the most toxic of dioxin-related compounds, and that the compound stayed precent in the body for long periods of time. Short-term exposure was noted to result in the development of skin lesions, and long-term exposure was noted to be linked to the development of cancers and impairments of major body systems. With regard to squamous cell skin carcinoma, Dr. M.S. cited a 2014 study showing that 51 percent of veterans exposed to TCDD (either working in areas contaminated by Agent Orange,\n---\nengaged in spraying Agent Orange, or traveling through contaminated areas) developed non-melanoma invasive skin cancer such as basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. This rate was twice as high as the average in men of similar ages. Dr. M.S. further noted that skin cancer risk factors included being fair-skinned with a history of sunburn and excessive ultraviolet light exposure. It was noted that the Veteran working long hours in the sun while stationed in Vietnam with post-service sun exposure. Based on the above, Dr. M.S. stated that there was a very clear causal connection between herbicides and skin cancer.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"ed1e7792-dcfb-4157-9293-7846a2118ea2":{"id_":"ed1e7792-dcfb-4157-9293-7846a2118ea2","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"b88f7dd7-4dd9-47b9-826e-b34e1e070437","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"hash":"yAA8HSggvaPiHclzYDM/b1/Ko6wK69xDi1vEKJRm9TY="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"f7f6b9f1-869f-4791-82ce-15ffc59ff5e5","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"hash":"3PwLgs1Wl76NTBb87hKjD+v8LB9dTRwid9vkBsAHw9k="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"3042343a-30ae-4ca1-95d4-58d84ade139d","metadata":{"file_path":"./data/A23009105.pdf"},"hash":"8HPBcB+j73dJJlkrJGQVqVR44tuqJC7PpgXpE9bxc90="}},"hash":"f4KKpDMWOr3J2HwZxhKsYktjEAGlJQ6V0nLUWvFUpJU=","text":"stated that there was a very clear causal connection between herbicides and skin cancer. Furthermore, in consideration of the numerous conditions the Veteran had which were attributable to herbicide exposure, Dr. M.S. opined that \"it is much more likely than not that said conditions are in fact the direct result of his in-service exposure. \" In providing the nexus opinion, Dr. M.S. stated he had reviewed the entire claims file, including all treatment records, VA examination, and considered the lay statements. After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for skin cancer, other than pursuant to the PACT Act, is not warranted. In this regard, actual exposure to herbicides is not conceded. Accordingly, as Dr. M.S.'s nexus opinion is primarily premised on exposure to herbicides, with regard to the Veteran's unverified herbicide exposure, this opinion is of no probative value. With regard to Dr. M.S.'s nexus opinion linking the Veteran's skin cancer to in-service sun exposure, the Board finds this opinion unsupported by the evidence of record, and, therefore, speculative in nature. Specifically, Dr. M.S. premised this opinion on a finding that the Veteran reported working long hours in the sun while stationed in Vietnam. However, the Veteran did not serve in Vietnam. He has additionally has not stated, and the evidence does not show, that his MOS of cook required him to work long hours in the sun without use of protective clothing or skin protection. Therefore, this opinion is unsupported by the evidence of record.

In this regard, the Board finds Dr. M.S.'s nexus opinion linking the Veteran's atrial fibrillation to his now service-connected hypertension the most probative evidence of record. Dr. M.S.'s opinion was based on a medical finding that patients with hypertension were twice as likely to develop atrial fibrillation. Dr. M.S. also noted that hypertension caused cardiac structural changes, including atrial remodeling, and affected the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in an adverse manner, an important factor in developing atrial fibrillation. The Board finds Dr. M.S. medical opinion persuasive as it is medically supported. Importantly, with regard to secondary service connection, there is no probative evidence to the contrary. ## However, as noted above, the effective date for inclusion of hypertension is October 1, 2026. Therefore, the Board is to consider entitlement to service connection for atrial fibrillation on a basis other than pursuant to the PACT Act. ## As noted above, without the presumptions offered by the PACT Act, exposure to herbicides has not been conceded. The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements that his atrial fibrillation is etiologically related to insecticide exposure.

A March 2016 medical record shows a past medical history for multiple lung nodules and a December 2015 imaging study revealed the presence of reticulonodular infiltrate. In October 2018, he was treated with antibiotics and a steroid injection for acute bronchitis. See Private Medical Records Received July 2020. A VA examination obtained in October 2020, notes the Veteran had not been diagnosed with a respiratory condition. No nexus opinion was provided. During his November 2022 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that his bronchitis reoccurred approximately every month resulting in symptoms of coughing and restricted breathing. He also testified that he used an inhaler to treat multiple lung nodules causing symptoms of shortness of breath and trouble breathing. After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for reticulonodular infiltrate, multiple lung nodules and bronchitis is not warranted.

The Veteran also underwent a VA examination in July 2020 noting a diagnosis for psoriasis. No etiological opinion was provided. In consideration that the Veteran was treated for a skin condition during service, and diagnoses provided by private medical records and the VA skin examination, the Board finds that a duty to assist existed at the time of the April 2021 rating decision to obtain a nexus opinion. Therefore, in order to cure the duty to assist error, the Board finds that a VA skin examination should be obtained. The matter is REMANDED for the following action:\n\n1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate examiner to determine the nature and etiology of any diagnosed skin condition other than skin cancer.

A claim will be considered a claim for compensation for a particular covered herbicide disease if the application and other supporting statements and submissions may reasonably be viewed, under the standards ordinarily governing compensation claims, as indicating an intent to apply for compensation for the covered herbicide disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 (c) (1)-(3). If the above criteria are met, the effective date of the award of service connection for a covered herbicide disease will be the later of the date such claim was received by VA or the date the disability arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 (c)(1), (c)(2). However, if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 (c)(1)-(2) are not met, the effective date shall be assigned according to 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114 and 3.400.

The record does not contain any communication from the Veteran or his representative indicating an intent to apply for service connection for lung cancer prior November 2016. The April 2005 and July 2013 claims for a respiratory/lung condition cannot reasonably be interpreted to include a claim for service connection for lung cancer. The Veteran was not diagnosed with lung cancer until 2016 and clinical testing prior to that date was negative for cancer. See Boggs v. Peake, 520 F.3d 1330 (Fed.

Additionally, the September 2005 and July 2014 denials of service connection for a lung condition were based on a lack of diagnosis, not a lack of qualifying Vietnam service. The appellant asserts that the Veteran's 1975 claim for VA education benefits should be construed as an original claim for lung cancer. This assertion is without merit. None of the submissions pertaining to the 1975 claim reflect an intent to seek VA disability compensation benefits, let alone for lung cancer or a lung condition due to herbicide exposure. The appellant notes a July 2011 VA memorandum indicating that April 6, 2005 \"is the earliest date of claim for Nehmer purposes was received by VA. \" She also notes that the RO assigned an effective date for the Veteran's service-connected DM based on the April 2005 claim. Unlike IHD and DM, the Veteran (and later, the appellant) have not continuously pursued a claim for lung cancer since April 2005. Testing in 2005 showed the Veteran did not have lung cancer and the condition was not diagnosed until 2016. The Board further notes that the July 2011 memorandum was prepared in connection with the separate claim for IHD. See December 20, 2021 Rating Decision. As the current effective date of September 6, 2016 is earlier than the date of claim for lung cancer (November 22, 2016), there is no basis in the law to grant an earlier effective date.

When the RO assigned the initial DM rating in August 2022, medical records showed treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and foot conditions from April 2005 to November 2017. Failing to consider these and other possible diabetic complications was a pre-decisional regulatory duty error. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155(d)(2); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021). The issue of service connection for IHD (claimed as Afib, CHF, CAD, and AAA) is remanded for a medical opinion addressing whether the Veteran's claimed heart conditions:\n\n(1) fall within the medical definition of IHD, `and/or;\n---\n(2) were caused by his service-connected DM. The Veteran was not afforded a VA heart examination/opinion during his lifetime and a medical opinion is necessary to decide the claim. Remand is also necessary to attempt to obtain outstanding private medical records related to a 2004 hospitalization for CHF. As noted above, the issue of entitlement to SMC(l) from September 6, 2016 to November 23, 2017 due to service-connected lung cancer was reasonably raised by the record at the time of the November 2022 rating decision.
